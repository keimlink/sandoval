Her mother, 'Beverly Marston-Braun' (qv), was known as \"Miss Beverly\", the host of _\"Romper Room\" (1953)_ (qv), a popular children's TV show, and her father was a Navy pilot. Wendy began acting at age 12, as the Scarecrow in \"The Wiz\", and continued performing in musicals and plays at Glenbrook South High School, as well as at Indiana University, where she graduated early to pursue acting. A trained professional dancer, Wendy spent a summer performing in Monte Carlo with such artists as 'Stevie Wonder' (qv), 'Barry White' (qv) and 'Natalie Cole' (qv). There she won over one of her biggest fans, 'Prince Albert of Monaco' (qv), who later escorted her to her film premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. Wendy soon starred in several award-winning film festival hits. 'Ivan Reitman' (qv) spotted her in two films at Sundance and cast her in DreamWorks' _Evolution (2001)_ (qv) alongside 'David Duchovny' (qv) and 'Julianne Moore' (qv). Her comedic timing and improvisation skills prompted ad executives to create a 26-spot Mervyn's campaign for her. A standout in these spots, Wendy quickly won more roles in film and television. She has been recently seen guest-starring on _\"Lost\" (2004)_ (qv), _\"All of Us\" (2003)_ (qv), _\"Navy NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service\" (2003)_ (qv), and acting alongside 'Martin Lawrence' (qv) in _Big Momma's House 2 (2006)_ (qv). Wendy is now recurring as \"Ms. Sneed\" on _\"General Hospital\" (1963)_ (qv) and plays 'Vincent Spano' (qv)'s FBI partner in the mini-series _Pandemic (2007) (TV)_ (qv). Wendy is also a fitness enthusiast and triathlete.

Both boys popped up unbilled alongside their mother in the film _The Company She Keeps (1951)_ (qv), and appeared on occasion with their famous dad on his popular underwater TV series _\"Sea Hunt\" (1958)_ (qv) while growing up. At age 14, Jeff toured with his father in a stage production of \"Anniversary Waltz\". The \"troublesome teen\" years proved just that for Jeff and his parents were compelled at one point to intervene when problems with drugs and marijuana got out of hand. He recovered and began shaping his nascent young adult career appearing on TV as a younger version of his father in the acclaimed TV-movie _Silent Night, Lonely Night (1969) (TV)_ (qv), and in the strange 'Burgess Meredith' (qv) film _The Yin and the Yang of Mr. Go (1970)_ (qv). Following fine notices for his portrayal of a white student caught up in the racially-themed _Halls of Anger (1970)_ (qv), his career-maker arrived just a year later when he earned a coming-of-age role in the critically-acclaimed ensemble film _The Last Picture Show (1971)_ (qv). The 'Peter Bogdanovich' (qv)- helmed film made stars out off its young leads (Bridges, 'Timothy Bottoms' (qv), 'Cybill Shepherd' (qv)) and Oscar winners out of its older cast ('Ben Johnson' (qv), 'Cloris Leachman' (qv)). The role, for which Jeff received an Oscar-nomination (for \"best supporting actor\") set the tone for the types of roles Jeff would acquaint himself with his fans -- rambling, reckless, rascally and usually unpredictable). Owning a casual carefree handsomeness and armed with a perpetual grin and sly charm, he started immediately on an intriguing 70s sojourn into offbeat filming. Chief among them were his boxer on his way up opposite a declining 'Stacy Keach' (qv) in _Fat City (1972)_ (qv); his Civil War-era conman in the western _Bad Company (1972)_ (qv); his redneck stock car racer in _The Last American Hero (1973)_ (qv); his young student anarchist opposite a stellar veteran cast in Eugene O'Neill's _The Iceman Cometh (1973)_ (qv); his bank-robbing (also Oscar-nominated) sidekick to 'Clint Eastwood' (qv) in _Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974)_ (qv); his aimless cattle rustler in _Rancho Deluxe (1975)_ (qv); his low-level western writer who wants to be a real-life cowboy in _Hearts of the West (1975)_ (qv); and his brother of an assassinated President who pursues leads to the crime in _Winter Kills (1979)_ (qv). All are simply marvelous characters that should have propelled him to the very top rungs of stardom...but strangely didn't. Perhaps it was his trademark ease and naturalistic approach that made him somewhat under appreciated at that time when Hollywood was run by a 'Dustin Hoffman' (qv), 'Robert De Niro' (qv) and 'Al Pacino' (qv)-like intensity. Neverthless, Jeff continued to be a scene-stealing favorite into the next decade, notably as the video game programmer in the 1982 sci-fi cult classic _TRON (1982)_ (qv), and the struggling musician brother vying with brother 'Beau Bridges' (qv) over the attentions of sexy singer 'Michelle Pfeiffer' (qv) in _The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989)_ (qv). Jeff became a third-time Oscar nominee with his highly intriguing (and strangely sexy) portrayal of a blank-faced alien in _\"Starman\" (1986)_ (qv), and earned high regard as the ever-optimistic inventor Preston Tucker in _Tucker: The Man and His Dream (1988)_ (qv). Since then Jeff has continued to pour on the Bridges magic on film. Few enjoy such an enduring popularity while maintaining equal respect with the critics. _The Fisher King (1991)_ (qv), _American Heart (1992)_ (qv), _Fearless (1993)_ (qv), _The Big Lebowski (1998)_ (qv) and _The Contender (2000)_ (qv) (a fourth Oscar nomination) are prime examples. More recently he seized the moment as a bald-pated villain as 'Robert Downey Jr.' (qv)'s nemesis in _Iron Man (2008)_ (qv). Jeff has been married since 1977 to non-professional Susan Geston (they met on the set of _Rancho Deluxe (1975)_ (qv)). The couple have three daughters, Isabelle (born 1981), Jessica (born 1983), and Hayley (born 1985). He hobbies as a photographer on and off his film sets, and has been known to play around as a cartoonist and pop musician."}}, {"pk": 362, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:17:08", "birthplace": "Los Angeles, California, USA", "surname": "Brockman", "created": "2009-03-10 21:17:08", "image": "images/persons/ungela-brockman.jpg", "birthdate": "24 February 1970", "imdb_id": "0110710", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 94, "forename": "Ungela", "height": 140, "slug": "ungela-brockman", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 233, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:07:30", "birthplace": "Quincy, Illinois, USA", "surname": "Brocksmith", "created": "2009-03-10 21:07:30", "image": "", "birthdate": "15 September 1945", "imdb_id": "0110735", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Roy", "height": null, "slug": "roy-brocksmith", "biography": "'Roy Brocksmith' (qv) began his career on the bar at Hap Kuhl's Tavern in his native Quincy, Illinois, at the age of three. As a boy soprano, he performed in churches, schools, and appeared regularly on local radio and television programs. At 16, he taught at the local children's theater. Two years later he married his high-school girlfriend. He left Quincy, touring the US for two years in the Oberammergau Passion Play of Richmond, Virginia. He returned and attended Hannibal LaGrange Junior College, Culver-Stockton College, and graduated from Quincy University in 1970. During this time, he directed for the community theater, Pragressive Playhouse, and founded the Great River Theater Workshop. As a director, he was taken to New York by a Ukrainian anesthesiologist in 1969, where he was joined by his wife and son, Blake (born 8/5/66). For one year he was a librarian at the Lilliam Morgan Hetrick Medical Library at Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital in Manhattan and was on the board of the American Association of Midwives. This regular job ended when he received his AEA union card-playing opposite 'John Carradine' (qv) in \"The Stingiest Man in Town,\" a musical based on 'Charles Dickens' (qv)'s \"A Christmas Carol\" and narrated by then-Mayor John Lindsay at New York's Town Hall. On the legit stage, he made his Broadway debut--and the cover of the New York Times Magazine (11/9/75)--in \"The Leaf People for 'Joseph Papp' (qv). He also appeared in Herr Tart\u00fcff with 'Mildred Dunnock' (qv) in \"Stages\" with 'Jack Warden' (qv) and sang \"Mack the Knife\" in 'Kurt Weill' (qv) & 'Bertolt Brecht' (qv)'s award-winning \"Threepenny Opera\" as the Ballad Singer in Papp's Lincoln Center revival (Original cast album and \"Broadway Magic of the Seventies\" CDs, both on Columbia/CBS Records), and as the King of France in \"The Three Musketeers.\" Off-Broadway shows included \"Polly,\" \"The Beggar's Opera,\" \"Dr. Salavy's Magic Theater,\" and \"In the Jungle of Cities\" with 'Al Pacino' (qv). He starred in the Broadway-bound \"Swing\" at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. At the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, he appeared in \"Arms and the Man (as Petkoff), 'William Shakespeare' (qv)'s \"As You Like It\" (as Touchstone), 'Thornton Wilder' (qv)'s \"Our Town\" (as Professor Willard), and 'Moli\u00e8re' (qv)'s \"Don Juan\" (as Sganarelle). This last garnered him the Kudos Award from the Minneapolis critics and the production was brought to the Delacourt Theater in New York by 'Joseph Papp' (qv), and he received international praise. His work with Papp and directors 'Richard Foreman' (qv) Liviu Cuilei, Stuart Ostrow, 'Tom O'Horgan' (qv), Andrei Serban, 'Alan Schneider' (qv), and 'John Cassavetes' (qv), to name just a few, made Brocksmith a solid part of America's most innovative and provocative theater. He was first to direct Foreman and Silverman's \"Africanis Instructus\" for Lyn Austin's Lennox Arts Center, and his adaptation of Feydeau's \"A Flea in Her Ear\" was presented under his direction at Baltimore's Center Stage. His unusual staging of Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" gave the Alaska Repertory Theater a major box-office and critical hit and was chosen out of 100 entries to be presented at the Joyce Theater in New York that season. He also appeared as Thurio in the national tour of John Guare's musical version of \"Two Gentelmen of Verona,\" and he made his California debut starring opposite 'Gena Rowlands' (qv). In 1987 he formed the California Cottage Theater with partner 'Michael Liscio' (qv), joining a long and formidable list of American actor-managers. As Producing Director he presented only new works: \"A Cold Day in Hell\" by January Quackenbush, Brocksmith's own \"Box Prelude OPUS #1,\" \"Matinee\" by Hal Corley, \"The One Less Traveled\" by Cary Pepper, \"A Necessary End\" by Joe Rubinoff, \"Ripe Conditions\" by Claudia Allen, and \"Letters from Queens\" by Brocksmith. The Cottage was unique because it was the only professional theater heater in the country under AEA jurisdiction for presentations in a private home. By its closing on February 17, 1996, over 8,000 people had attended performances. It was hailed as \"Suburbia's Rialto\" (Wall Street Journal), \"The epicenter of quirky folk\" (L.A. Weekly), \"Pick of the Week\" (L.A.Times), and \"Critic's Choice\" (Drama Logue). Calling himself a theater craftsman, it was Brocksmith's belief that \"good theater is not a matter of money and place as it is a matter of imagination, craft and guts.\" The concept of the California Cottage Theater, a professional theater for free, was, to him, theater in its most essential form. Brocksmith also appeared on several episodes of _\"3-2-1 Contact\" (1980)_ (qv) in its \"Bloodhound Gang\" segment and on an episode of _\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" (1987)_ (qv).

He has recently seen a massive surge in his career, finding well-known roles such as a policeman, a hunter, and the President of the United States. Born February 12, 1968, Brolin was initially against the lifestyle of the entertainment business, in light of his parents' divorce, and both of them being actors. However, he fell for theatre after playing a part in a school production of \"A Streetcar named Desire\". His first major screen role was as the older brother in the film _The Goonies (1985)_ (qv) based on a story by 'Steven Spielberg' (qv). He then immediately moved on to work on television, taking roles in such series as \"Private Eye\" and \"The Young Riders\". \"Private Eye\" was a chance for Brolin to play a detective. \"The Young Riders\" was set just before the Civil War, and was co-directed by Brolin's father, 'James Brolin' (qv). After \"The Young Riders\", Brolin moved back to the big screen, with mediocre success. He played a supporting role in _The Road Killers (1994)_ (qv), but the film was not a hit. He followed up with the crime film _Gang in Blue (1996)_ (qv), the romantic film _Bed of Roses (1996)_ (qv), the thriller film _Nightwatch (1997)_ (qv), and appeared with his father in _My Brother's War (1997)_ (qv). However, nothing truly stuck out, especially not the box office flop _The Mod Squad (1999)_ (qv). The 2000s initially brought no significant change in Brolin's career. He appeared in the independent film _Slow Burn (2000)_ (qv), the sci-fi thriller _Hollow Man (2000)_ (qv) and starred in the television series \"Mister Sterling\". In 2004, he married actress 'Diane Lane' (qv), and as of now are still together. It was not until 2007 that Brolin received much acclaim for his films. He took a supporting role in the 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv)-written _Grindhouse (2007)_ (qv) which was a two-part film accounting two horror stories. He also played two policemen that year: a corrupt officer Trupo in the crime epic _American Gangster (2007)_ (qv), and an honest police chief in the emotional drama _In the Valley of Elah (2007)_ (qv) which starred 'Tommy Lee Jones' (qv) and was directed by 'Paul Haggis' (qv). However, it was his involvement in _No Country for Old Men (2007)_ (qv) that truly pushed him into the limelight. The film, directed by the Coen brothers, was about a man (Brolin) who finds a satchel containing two million dollars in cash. He is pursued by an unstoppable assassin ('Javier Bardem' (qv) who won an Oscar for his work) and his friend, a local sheriff ('Tommy Lee Jones' (qv)). The film won four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. Brolin found high-profile work the next year, being cast as Supervisor Dan White in the film _Milk (2008/I)_ (qv) and will play the role of 'George W. Bush' (qv) in the 'Oliver Stone' (qv) film W (2009). Despite his mediocre success and fame, Brolin has maintained a choosiness in his films, and recently, these choices have paid off profoundly.

As a child, Bruce watched _\"Lost in Space\" (1965)_ (qv) on TV, and ran around dressed as Zorro. He got the acting bug at age 8; his dad was performing in local community theater. At 14, Bruce got to play the young prince in \"The King and I\" and even got to sing. He went on to appear in several community theater productions, including \"South Pacific\". However, he was also interested in directing, and shot super-8 flicks with a neighborhood pal. Perhaps through fate, he met future director 'Sam Raimi' (qv) in a high school drama class in 1975. Soon, along with Sam, and now a bunch of other high school pals, Bruce filmed about 50 super-8 movies. During the summer of 1976, he was an apprentice in northern Michigan at Traverse City's Cherry County Playhouse, a summer-stock company. Bruce worked 18-hour days putting up sets, being assistant stage manager, doing errands, etc. No money, but it was a learning experience (it was show biz). He attended Western Michigan University and took theater courses. Bruce became a production assistant for a company that made commercials in Detroit. In the early part of 1979, with buddy 'Sam Raimi' (qv), he decided to become a pro filmmaker. Armed with a super-8 horror film _Within the Woods (1978)_ (qv) which they showed potential investors, they raised $350,000 to make _The Evil Dead (1981)_ (qv) which Bruce co-produced and starred in as \"Ash\". Four years later, the completed film became the best-selling video of 1983 in England, and New Line Cinema got it a US release. Around this time, he married his first wife, and they had 2 kids. They raised 10 times as much cash for the sequel _Evil Dead II (1987)_ (qv) again co-produced by Bruce and starring him as \"Ash\". He moved to L.A. In 1990, while filming _Mindwarp (1992)_ (qv), he met his future second wife (costume designer 'Ida Gearon' (qv)) on the set. In 1992, he rejoined Sam, and Bruce co-produced and starred as \"Ash\" in the 3rd of the Evil Dead trilogy, _Army of Darkness (1992)_ (qv) for Universal Studios. On TV, Bruce directed many episodes of _\"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\" (1995)_ (qv). Bruce also acted as the recurring character \"Autolycus\", the King of Thieves; he portrayed this villain with zest in both _\"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\" (1995)_ (qv) and _\"Xena: Warrior Princess\" (1995)_ (qv). Bruce's latest television venture was starring as the title rogue of _\"Jack of All Trades\" (2000)_ (qv). Everybody loves Jack.

With that experience he returned to Hollywood, landing the short-lived TV series _\"Shane\" (1966)_ (qv) before being tapped to star opposite 'Barbara Hershey' (qv) in 'Martin Scorsese' (qv)'s first Hollywood film, _Boxcar Bertha (1972)_ (qv). The iconic _\"Kung Fu\" (1972)_ (qv) followed, catapulting Carradine to superstardom for the next three years, until he left the series to pursue his film career. That career now includes more than 100 feature films, a couple of dozen television movies, a whole range of theater on and off Broadway, and another hit series, _Kung Fu: The Legend Continues (1992) (TV)_ (qv). Carradine received the Best Actor Award from the National Board of Film Review as well as a Golden Globe nomination for his portrayal of 'Woody Guthrie' (qv) in 'Hal Ashby' (qv)'s _Bound for Glory (1976)_ (qv), and won critical acclaim for his work as Cole Younger in _The Long Riders (1980)_ (qv). \"Kung Fu\" also received seven Emmy nominations in its first season, including one for Carradine as Best Actor. In addition he won the People's Prize at the Cannes Film Festival's \"Director's Fortnight\" for his work on _Americana (1983)_ (qv), and a second Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role in _\"North and South\" (1985)_ (qv). Among his other most notable film credits are _Gray Lady Down (1978)_ (qv), _Mean Streets (1973)_ (qv), _Bird on a Wire (1990)_ (qv), _The Long Goodbye (1973)_ (qv), _The Serpent's Egg (1977)_ (qv) and _Circle of Iron (1978)_ (qv). He recently returned to the screen in what could be his greatest performance to date, playing the title role in 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv)'s _Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)_ (qv) and _Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)_ (qv) (Miramax), for which he received his fourth Golden Globe nomination. Carradine has also continued his devotion to music, and has recorded some 60 tracks from various musical genres and sung in several movies. He makes his home in Los Angeles with his wife Annie, her four children and their two dogs."}}, {"pk": 175, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:03:31", "birthplace": "New York City, New York, USA", "surname": "Carrera", "created": "2009-03-10 21:03:31", "image": "images/persons/asia-carrera.jpg", "birthdate": "6 August 1973", "imdb_id": "0006562", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "Asia", "height": 125, "slug": "asia-carrera", "biography": "'Asia Carrera' (qv)'s stunning curves can be seen in more than 250 hardcore movies.

'Sonny Chiba' (qv) wasn't a graceful, fluid fighter like screen icon 'Bruce Lee' (qv), but rather he was a ferocious machine that mowed down his opponents with his fists and feet, always with a menacing grimace on his face!Chiba was born Sadao Maeda in Fukuoka, Japan in 1939 and shared a house along with four other siblings to a father who was a military test pilot. As a youth, he was keen on both theatre and gymnastics, and was a talented enough athlete to score a position in the Japanese Olympic Team, until a chronic back injury finished his gymnastic aspirations. However, whilst at university he took a strong interest in karate under the guidance of the legendary \"Mas Oyama\", and soon earned his first black belt. However, his life took another turn, when in 1960 he was discovered during a talent search by Toei Studios, and he soon began his screen career under the name of \"Shinichi Chiba\", appearing as \"Space Chief\" in _Uchu Kaisoku-ken (1961)_ (aka \"Invasion of the Neptune Men). Over the next decade, Chiba busied himself with many appearances in Japanese crime thrillers and steadily built a reputation for playing hard men of few words and direct actions. With his martial arts proficiency in karate, judo & kenpo, he was in the box seat to take advantage of the early 1970s martial arts boom commenced by Chinese superstar 'Bruce Lee' (qv), and Chiba starred in the brutal and uncompromising _Gekitotsu! Satsujin ken (1974)_ (qv) (aka \"The Streetfighter\"). The film has Chiba playing a mercenary style, street thug who will do anything for a price, and take on most anyone, including the Japanese Yakuza. The approach of the film was quite different from the 'Bruce Lee' (qv) films in that Lee only eliminated his enemies when he was defending his friends or his honor. Quite the opposite, Chiba was only after a fistful of dollars for his deadly services and would engage in mortal combat for the highest bidder, although this often clouded his judgement to his own detriment. The only person \"The Street Fighter\" respects is his martial arts teacher, the short rotund, karate master \"Masaoko\" played by 'Masafumi Suzuki' (qv), who manages to easily out smart and out fight the frustrated Chiba! Upon its release, the film was roundly criticised for its excessive violence, including the amazing finale where a lethal blow to the ringleader's skull is shown in x-ray on screen. Fans didn't care, and they flocked in their thousands to see this economically made, yet eye catching chop socky spectacular. A sequel quickly followed with him back again in the messy production _Satsujin ken 2 (1974)_ (qv) (aka \"Return of The Streetfighter\"), which was followed by a third Streetfighter movie also starring female martial arts dynamo 'Etsuko Shihomi' (qv) in the gritty _Onna hissatsu ken (1974)_ (qv) (aka \"Sister Street Fighter\"), and then the fourth and final film in the series _Gyakushu Satsujin ken (1974)_ (aka \"The Street Fighters Last Revenge\"), which was arguably the best of all the sequels. Chiba had firmly established himself as a key anti-hero of Asian martial arts cinema who said little, and used his fists to sort out his troubles. With the demand high from keen action fans, he remained remarkably busy on screen for the next twenty years starring in numerous Japanese film & TV productions with an emphasis on bruising fights, samurai swords, Yakuza gangsters and pretty girls in trouble. Outside of Japan, the \"Street Fighter\" series of films has achieved enduring popularity through many midnight cult screenings, and their style heavily influenced a youthful indie filmaker named 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv). Tarantino has used strong references and imagery from the \"Street Fighter\" movies in several of his films including _True Romance (1993)_ (qv) and _Pulp Fiction (1995)_. And when Tarantino came around to casting his mammoth _Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)_ (qv) project, he was awed to have Chiba accept the key role of the hot headed, and sometimes humourous, Okinawan sword maker \"Hattori Hanzo. 'Sonny Chiba' (qv) has undoubtedly been a major figure and ongoing influence in the worldwide passion for martial arts movies for over thirty years, and he continues to actively contribute to the genre by encouraging & training young hopefuls seeking to make their mark on screen."}}, {"pk": 55, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 20:56:47", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Clancy", "created": "2009-03-10 20:56:47", "image": "images/persons/hamilton-clancy.jpg", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "1750388", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 93, "forename": "Hamilton", "height": 140, "slug": "hamilton-clancy", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 314, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:12:04", "birthplace": "Macon, Georgia, USA", "surname": "Clark", "created": "2009-03-10 21:12:04", "image": "", "birthdate": "2 February 1946", "imdb_id": "0163703", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Blake", "height": null, "slug": "blake-clark", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 363, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:17:10", "birthplace": "Seoul, South Korea", "surname": "Clark", "created": "2009-03-10 21:17:10", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0006480", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Madison", "height": null, "slug": "madison-clark", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 154, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:02:24", "birthplace": "Humboldt, Iowa, USA", "surname": "Clemenson", "created": "2009-03-10 21:02:24", "image": "images/persons/christian-clemenson.jpg", "birthdate": "17 March 1958", "imdb_id": "0166061", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "Christian", "height": 125, "slug": "christian-clemenson", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 43, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:15:34", "birthplace": "Lexington, Kentucky, USA", "surname": "Clooney", "created": "2009-03-10 20:56:05", "image": "images/persons/george-clooney.jpg", "birthdate": "6 May 1961", "imdb_id": "0000123", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "George", "height": 140, "slug": "george-clooney", "biography": "Born in Lexington, Kentucky, as son of 'Nick Clooney' (qv), a TV newscaster of many years, who hosted a talk show at Cincinnati and often invited George into the studios already at the age of 5.

As a child growing up in the 'projects' (as they were called) he put on plays starring his younger brothers and sister then charged his parents to attend. You could see even as child Carlo was torn between artistic values and monetary values. As a teenager he filmed his younger siblings football games and then would help edit and score a highlight reel with his Mom (Martha) for the season's banquet finale. In junior high school Carlo was in charge of the stage lighting for the plays while starring in sports. In high school, he lettered and starred in both Varsity football and baseball. He also took a class on 'stagecraft' learning the art work and stage design for theatre. Between working and sports, on the outside Carlo's life appeared to be on the up and up, though in his time off he would journey into the darker side of life as a teen. By the early 1980s, Carlo's son was born. That was a profound moment in his life. It was also a quick dose of reality for the athletic and creative genius/problem child (one minute a star - the next minute a husband and father) but it may have saved his life. Life on the streets as a thug can take its toll on one's health and did for some of Carlo's partners in crime. He saw a few friends and acquaintances pass. It also took a toll on his marriage. He and first wife Laurie divorced after three years. Working in a 'dead end' job and just unhappy with his life's direction, he started playing football again in a Fairfield County league with one of his best friends where he not only starred, but helped lead his team to several titles. Unfortunately a knee injury ended any chance of him playing anymore or possibly going further with football (American). By 1986, he looked towards the theatre and within days after signing on into an acting class in Bridgeport, Connecticut he found himself co-starring in a version of the Sam Sheppard play 'True West'. That helped him land his first role in film as 'The Jogger' for an independent film called 'Beyonder' by Mike Leoce. This eventually led him to a follow up role in 'The Game' written and directed by David Prank. It was while filming the 'Beyonder' that one of the female leads introduced him to his acting mentors; Rick Poole and Kathryn Gately at a Theatre Row acting studio inside the Nat Horne Theatre in NYC. There he also took dance classes from greats like Nat Horne, and Anna Sokolov. Poole and Gately worked at the Neighborhood Playhouse prior to opening their own studios and were arguably two of the best disciples of Sandy Meisner in NYC at the time. At the same time he competed in a modeling pageant from which the likes of Patrick Dempsey emerged. This gave Carlo the opportunities he needed to land on a Soap Opera in Manhattan, then several other print and film opportunities in New York then Los Angeles (ie:Structure, calendars, film and TV). A good friend who was the Vice President of the 'Stephen Nichols' fan club, offered to be President of Carlo's fan club. Her name is Jodi Davidowski. Unfortunately for the world Jodi is no longer with us. She passed away in 2004 from a brain tumor. Her kindness, and friendship will be missed by a lot of people, especially by Stephen and Carlo. Traversing coasts and once in Los Angeles he wandered through agents, managers, and auditions landing several roles and working night owl jobs like bartending at the 'Red Onion' and private dancing. In 1993 he and his business partner, photographer Dean McKeever decided to put together a female swimsuit calendar called 'The Supercalendar' that featured the likes of 'Gena Lee Nolin' (see photo gallery) just prior to her fame and fortune. Other photographers that helped out on the project were; Chris Shay, Brent Schafer, Denice Porter, and Jimmy Pickering. In 1995, Carlo co-produced, wrote, directed, and starred in a movie for television, which aired on a Cox Communications cable channels in early 1997 and which co-starred his friend actor Richard Dino (From Dusk 2 Dawn) also featuring several family members (including a photo of his son). In March of 1996, Carlo attended the 'Academy Awards and Governor's Ball' with Richard Dino and the two headed to the Vanity Fair party at Morton's on Melrose and Robertson in Beverly Hills where he ran into a former classmate from New York who was starring in a sitcom. By the summer of 1998, his son chose a prestigious 'East Coast' school to do his undergrad degree. It was at that time Carlo also met his soul-mate and second wife Mariana. She is from the Palermo Hollywood area in the Capital, Buenos Aires, Argentina and is over 15 years his junior. They currently reside in the 'Sand Canyon' area of Santa Clarita in Los Angeles county with their 'Yorkie' named 'Anush'. The three spend a lot of time at the home of Mariana's Mom - Ana, and relax by playing golf and vacationing to Argentina visiting Mariana's family and friends or heading back east to visit Carlo's Mom-Martha and his son M1ke. Though not completely giving up the 'acting bug' Carlo is currently pursuing an executive career. After holding the position of President of his privately owned corporation; Sidustar International, Inc. he is now a Vice President with the number one emergency and rapid mass notification company in the world; the National Notification Network (3nonline.com). He also received his M.B.A. online as an honorary degree from Almeda University for his contributions in communications and technology. Still he is quick to say that he's not the executive star of the family. That title belongs to his son Michael, who received his MBA in May (2005) from UCONN's graduate school in Stamford, Connecticut, and had also received his Bachelor of Science from Fairfield University in Southern Connecticut in 2002. Michael was also invited to be a member of the prestigious club, 'Mensa International', an intellectual society."}}, {"pk": 96, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 20:59:06", "birthplace": "Lamesa, Texas, USA", "surname": "Corbin", "created": "2009-03-10 20:59:06", "image": "images/persons/barry-corbin.jpg", "birthdate": "16 October 1940", "imdb_id": "0179224", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "Barry", "height": 138, "slug": "barry-corbin", "biography": "Barry's full given name is Leonard Barrie Corbin, and he was born on October 16, 1940, to Kilmer Blain Corbin, an attorney, and Alma Corbin, an elementary school teacher in Lamesa Texas.

When he was four, his parents divorced and Michael, his sister Karen and his mother Patricia headed for New York, but they didn't stay long and soon ended up in L.A. (in 1972), where his step-father, a jazz musician named Walter Urban Jr, intended to start a career. 'Flea' (qv) would often sit in on weekly jam sessions with his stepdad and the constant flow of musicians who trucked through. High school was not always an easy road for young Michael. He was kind of a misfit because of his unusual musical taste. While most of the kids were into disco and dance music, 'Flea' (qv) preferred jazz artists like 'Miles Davis' (qv) and 'Dizzy Gillespie' (qv). 'Flea' (qv)'s first musical instrument were the drums, but soon he choosed the trumpet; after school he would race home to listen to his Gillespie records and play along with his idol. He counts as his greatest childhood memory the time his mother got him backstage to meet Gillespie after one of his concerts. He also played with the Los Angeles Junior Philarmonic Orchestra. Influenced by some of his friends from school who shared the same passion for music - among them, 'Jack Irons' (qv) and 'Hillel Slovak' (qv), who would later play in the 'Red Hot Chili Peppers' (qv) with him - his musical interests then diversified, he discovered funk music, and 'Jimi Hendrix' (qv) became his new idol. At the end of 1977, he met 'Anthony Kiedis' (qv). For some reason, Michael was holding a young schoolmate named Tony Sherr in a headlock, when Kiedis, who was Tony's best friend at the time, came to rescue him, and the both almost had a fight, but soon became aware they were made to be friends, and have been inseparable since. The two became known for their mischievous antics, which often got them into trouble. That's also at this time that he gained his nickname 'Flea' (qv), while he was joking with some friends about calling each other with a cartoon name. Around 1979, due to 'Flea' (qv)'s obvious musical talent, he was sought out as a recruit for a band formed by his schoolmates, Anthym, with 'Jack Irons' (qv) (drums), 'Hillel Slovak' (qv) (guitar) and 'Alain Johannes' (qv) (vocals and guitar) as members. 'Flea' (qv) picked up the bass, which he had never played before, and became so good that within a few months he had forged his very own style, which later would make him one of the most famous and talented bass players in the world. After a shaky start the band got a few club gigs but no major breaks. 'Anthony Kiedis' (qv) was always there to support them, and became the presenter of their shows, that he opened with a few jokes or improvised poems of his own. During the year 1982, 'Flea' (qv) joined the L.A. punk band Fear. He also landed a small role in the 'Penelope Spheeris' (qv) film Suburbia (1984) . John Lydon of PIL asked 'Flea' (qv) to join his band when he left Fear in 1984, but 'Flea' (qv) decided to rejoin his friends instead. With Kiedis, Slovak and Irons, they had started another band together, the 'Red Hot Chili Peppers' (qv), which soon earned a good reputation in the Los Angeles underground music scene. 'Flea' (qv) was married in 1985 to Loesha Zeviar, whose first name he got tattooed above his left nipple - close to his heart. They have since divorced, but still share daughter Clara, born on September 16, 1988. Clara sometimes goes on theroad with her dad, and has done artwork for the Chili Peppers' t-shirts and promotional material. In 2001, along with friends Pete Weiss and Keith Barry, 'Flea' (qv) founded the Silverlake Conservatory Of Music, a organization whose aim is to provide affordable music lessons to everyone and to encourage children's musical education."}}, {"pk": 135, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:00:59", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Flick", "created": "2009-03-10 21:00:59", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "2318505", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Scott", "height": null, "slug": "scott-flick", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 193, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:05:00", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Fortenberry", "created": "2009-03-10 21:05:00", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0287200", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Millford", "height": null, "slug": "millford-fortenberry", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 384, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:18:21", "birthplace": "Indianapolis, Indiana, USA", "surname": "Fox", "created": "2009-03-10 21:18:21", "image": "images/persons/vivica-a-fox.jpg", "birthdate": "30 July 1964", "imdb_id": "0000407", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "Vivica A.", "height": 135, "slug": "vivica-a-fox", "biography": "'Vivica A.

"height": 138, "slug": "ben-gazzara", "biography": "'Ben Gazzara' (qv)'s screen career began with two critically acclaimed roles as heavies in the late fifties. He turned to television in the sixties but made a big screen comeback with roles in three 'John Cassavetes' (qv) films in the seventies. The 1980s and 1990s saw Gazzara work more frequently than ever before in character parts. If he never became the leading man his early films and stage work promised he has had a career notable for its longevity. He was born Biagio Anthony Gazzara in New York City in 1930. The son of a Sicilian immigrant laborer, he grew up on New York's tough Lower East Side. After seeing 'Laurette Taylor' (qv) in \"The Glass Menagerie\", Gazzara decided he wanted to become an actor. He studied engineering (unhappily) but quit after receiving an acting scholarship (he worked under well-known coach 'Erwin Piscator' (qv)). He then joined the Actors' Studio where a group of students improvised a play from 'Calder Willingham' (qv)'s novel End as a Man. The tale of a brutal Southern Military academy reached Broadway slightly changed in 1953 but with Gazzara still in the principal role. It was a star making part (he won a Theatre World award) and he then played leads in the original productions of \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" (1955) and \"A Hatful of Rain\" (1955) (he was nominated for a Tony). Bigger names 'Paul Newman' (qv) and 'Don Murray' (qv) played those last two roles on the big screen but Gazzara made his movie debut in _The Strange One (1957)_ (qv) the film version of \"End as a Man\". The film was a critical but not commercial success. His next role was as the defendant in _Anatomy of a Murder (1959)_ (qv) which was a big hit. He followed this with an Italian venture co-starring 'Anna Magnani' (qv), _Risate di gioia (1960)_ (qv), two Hollywood films _The Young Doctors (1961)_ (qv) and _Convicts 4 (1962)_ (qv) and then another Italian film _Citt\u00e0 prigioniera, La (1962)_ (qv). None of these did much for his career and he turned to television. He appeared in the successful shows _\"Arrest and Trial\" (1963)_ (qv) and _\"Run for Your Life\" (1965)_ (qv). In between, he made _A Rage to Live (1965)_ (qv), a film version of 'John O'Hara' (qv)'s novel. He returned to films in _The Bridge at Remagen (1969)_ (qv) and with a cameo appearance in _If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium (1969)_ (qv). His buddy in the cameo was 'John Cassavetes' (qv) who directed and co-starred with him in _Husbands (1970)_ (qv), a critical success. Gazzara made two more well-received films with his good friend Cassavetes: _The Killing of a Chinese Bookie (1976)_ (qv) and _Opening Night (1977)_ (qv). Gazzara's other films in the 1970s were undistinguished apart from the sprawling _Voyage of the Damned (1976)_ (qv) and a rare leading role in director 'Peter Bogdanovich' (qv)'s _Saint Jack (1979)_ (qv). _Bloodline (1979)_ (qv) and _They All Laughed (1981)_ (qv) (also directed by Bogdanovich) were only notable because of Gazzara's off-screen relationship with co-star 'Audrey Hepburn' (qv) (ironically, Gazzara had declined to make his screen debut in _War and Peace (1956)_ (qv) starring Hepburn). _Storie di ordinaria follia (1981)_ (qv) was another lead for Gazzara but it received a mixed critical reception. Other big screen roles in the eighties were scarce apart from _Road House (1989)_ (qv), a 'Patrick Swayze' (qv) vehicle which Gazzara believed out of all his films has been the most repeated on television. He worked much on the small screen, including the ground-breaking television movie _An Early Frost (1985) (TV)_ (qv), playing the father of an AIDS victim. The 1990s saw Gazzarra working like never before, appearing in 38 films! Most were for free-to-air television or cable but he also worked on the big screen in _The Spanish Prisoner (1997)_ (qv), _The Big Lebowski (1998)_ (qv), _Happiness (1998)_ (qv) and _Summer of Sam (1999)_ (qv). His TV work included a guest appearance as an executive assistant attorney in a 2001 episode of _\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" (1999)_ (qv) - a nice touch since _\"Arrest and Trial\" (1963)_ (qv) was the predecessor of _\"Law & Order\" (1990)_ (qv) and its spin-off shows. Gazzara has often returned to the stage throughout his career - in \"The Night Circus\" (1958) (where he met second wife 'Janice Rule' (qv)), \"Strange Interlude\" (1963), \"Traveller Without Luggage\" (1964), Hughie/Duet (1975) (nominated for a Tony), \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (1976) (again Tony nominated) and \"Shimada\" (1992). He has also worked as a director on episodes his series _\"Run for Your Life\" (1965)_ (qv) and _\"The Name of the Game\" (1968)_ (qv) and the television movies _Columbo: A Friend in Deed (1974) (TV)_ (qv) and _Columbo: Troubled Waters (1975) (TV)_ (qv) featuring his friend 'Peter Falk' (qv). The unreleased _Oltre l'oceano (1990)_ (qv) (which he also wrote) is his final film as a director to date. Now in his seventies, Gazzara is still acting. In 2003 he appeared in the independent _Dogville (2003)_ (qv) adding 'Lars von Trier' (qv) to the list of interesting and acclaimed directors with whom he has worked. There can't be many actors who can boast that they have acted in films by 'Otto Preminger' (qv) (_Anatomy of a Murder (1959)_ (qv)), 'John Cassavetes' (qv), 'Joel Coen' (qv) (_Big Lebowksi, The (1998)_ ), 'Spike Lee' (qv) (_Summer of Sam (1999)_ (qv)) and 'Lars von Trier' (qv) among others!"}}, {"pk": 290, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:10:21", "birthplace": "", "surname": "George", "created": "2009-03-10 21:10:21", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "1623378", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Nelson", "height": null, "slug": "nelson-george", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 147, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:02:03", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Gilmore", "created": "2009-03-10 21:02:03", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0319541", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Jimmie Dale", "height": null, "slug": "jimmie-dale-gilmore", "biography": "Country-folk singer/songwriter 'Jimmie Dale Gilmore' (qv) is best known for his unusual fusion of traditional honky-tonk, Hank Williams-ish country stylings with lyrics influenced by Eastern mysticism and philosophy. Born and raised among country musicians in West Texas, Gilmore grew up in Lubbock, a small, dying cattle ranch community that, by chance, has produced some of Texas' most critically acclaimed musicians, including the great Buddy Holly, folk songstress Nanci Griffith, country superstar Waylon Jennings, and Gilmore's friends and collaborators, Joe Ely and Butch Hancock. Part Cherokee, Gilmore's look and style have always been somewhat unusual for the honky-tonk milieu. Gilmore briefly attempted a music career after high school, forming the now-legendary Flatlanders with Hancock and Ely, but by 1974 his growing interest in spirituality led him to leave Texas behind - and music along with it - to join a Taoist community in Denver, Colorado. In the '80s, having developed an aesthetic that merged his love of country with his spiritual interests, Gilmore moved to Austin, Texas to re-initiate his music career, and within a few months was playing regularly around town. He released two independent label records in the late '80s before Elektra released his breakthrough album \"Spinning Around the Sun\" in 1993. The album made numerous end-of-the-year 'best of' lists in the media, and Gilmore's career was given an extra boost by high profile fans such as David Letterman and Natalie Merchant. Gilmore's reputation was further enhanced by the reissue of an out-of-print Flatlanders record made in Nashville in 1972, released by Rounder records in 1991 under the title 'More a Legend Than a Band.' He has continued to release solo records, and in 2002, reunited with high school buddies Butch Hancock and Joe Ely (the Bruce Springsteen of Texas), to reform the Flatlanders. Gilmore's first film appearance was a brief cameo in 1993's 'The Thing Called Love,' an account of young singer/songwriters trying to break into the Nashville music scene, directed by Peter Bogdanovich and starring then-unknown Sandra Bullock and River Phoenix in one of his final roles. In 1996, Gilmore was recruited by his producer, T-Bone Burnett, to appear in the new Coen Brothers film, 'The Big Lebowski,' on which Burnett was also working as musical director (One of the world's foremost authorities on traditional American music, Burnett has collaborated on several Coen films, and was largely responsible for the massively successful 'O Brother, Where Art Thou' soundtrack). Gilmore appears as Smokey, the 'pacifist' bowler whom John Goodman's Walter threatens to shoot for allegedly stepping 'over the line' when throwing a strike. The inside joke, of course, is that, as a practicing Taoist, Gilmore is himself a pacifist. Gilmore was also recruited by fan and friend Billy Bob Thornton to contribute to the soundtrack and appear briefly in \"Monster's Ball\" singing in a honky-tonk; he has also contributed original music for the soundtrack of Robert Redford's \"The Horse Whisperer.\""}}, {"pk": 247, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:08:12", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Glockner", "created": "2009-03-10 21:08:12", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0322953", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Eleanor", "height": null, "slug": "eleanor-glockner", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 132, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:00:52", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Gomez", "created": "2009-03-10 21:00:52", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "2655188", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "David A.", "height": null, "slug": "david-a-gomez", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 159, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:02:38", "birthplace": "Dallas, Texas, USA", "surname": "Gomez", "created": "2009-03-10 21:02:38", "image": "", "birthdate": "18 April 1951", "imdb_id": "0327059", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Mike", "height": null, "slug": "mike-gomez", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 138, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:09:10", "birthplace": "St. Louis, Missouri, USA", "surname": "Goodman", "created": "2009-03-10 21:01:27", "image": "images/persons/john-goodman.jpg", "birthdate": "20 June 1952", "imdb_id": "0000422", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 98, "forename": "John", "height": 140, "slug": "john-goodman", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 285, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:10:04", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Gould", "created": "2009-03-10 21:10:04", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0332349", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "David", "height": null, "slug": "david-gould", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 221, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:06:10", "birthplace": "Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA", "surname": "Gould", "created": "2009-03-10 21:06:10", "image": "", "birthdate": "29 April 1957", "imdb_id": "0332380", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Geoffrey", "height": null, "slug": "geoffrey-gould", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 353, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:16:42", "birthplace": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA", "surname": "Graham", "created": "2009-03-10 21:16:42", "image": "images/persons/aimee-graham.jpg", "birthdate": "20 September 1971", "imdb_id": "0333888", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "Aimee", "height": 138, "slug": "aimee-graham", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 99, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 20:59:19", "birthplace": "Gadsden, Alabama, USA", "surname": "Grant", "created": "2009-03-10 20:59:19", "image": "images/persons/beth-grant.jpg", "birthdate": "18 September 1949", "imdb_id": "0335275", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 93, "forename": "Beth", "height": 139, "slug": "beth-grant", "biography": "Raised in the South, 'Beth Grant' (qv) moved frequently as a child and enjoys claiming several towns and cities in Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina as home.

Hayek has freely admitted that she and her brother, Sami, were spoiled rotten by her well-to-do Lebanese-Mexican businessman father and her Mexican-born opera-singing mother. After having seen _Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971)_ (qv) in a local movie theatre, Salma decided she wanted to become an actress. Her education included a stint at a New Orleans convent school, where she pulled pranks on the nuns by setting their clocks back three hours. She was soon expelled. Only after attending Mexico City's Universidad Iberoamericana did she feel ready to pursue acting seriously. She soon landed the title role in _\"Teresa\" (1989)_ (qv), a hugely successful soap opera which earned her the star status in her native Mexico. However, anxious to make films and to explore her talent and passion, Hayek left both _\"Teresa\" (1989)_ (qv) and Mexico in 1991. Heartbroken fans spread rumors that she was having a secret affair with Mexico's president and left to escape his wife's wrath. At long last, Salma made her way to Los Angeles. The 24 year old actress approached Hollywood with na\u00efve enthusiasm, and quickly learned that Latin actresses were, if at all, typecast as the mistress maid or local prostitute. By late 1992, Hayek had landed only bit parts. She appeared on _\"Street Justice\" (1991)_ (qv), _\"The Sinbad Show\" (1993)_ (qv), _\"Nurses\" (1991)_ (qv), and as a sexy maid on the HBO series _\"Dream On\" (1990)_ (qv). She also had one line in the 'Allison Anders' (qv) film _Mi vida loca (1993)_ (qv). Feeling under-appreciated by Anglo filmmakers, Hayek vented her frustrations on comedian 'Paul Rodriguez' (qv)'s late-night Spanish-language talk show in 1992. 'Robert Rodriguez' (qv) and his producer wife 'Elizabeth Avellan' (qv) happened to be watching and were immediately smitten with the intelligent, opinionated young woman. He soon gave her her big break--to star opposite 'Antonio Banderas' (qv) in the now cult classic _Desperado (1995)_ (qv), which put her on Hollywood's map. The moviegoers proved to be as dazzled with Hayek as he had been. After her break, she was cast again by Rodriguez to star in his _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv). Although her vampy role opposite 'George Clooney' (qv) and 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) was a small one, it was a good credit to her box office name. Hayek's first star billing came later that year with _Fools Rush In (1997)_ (qv) opposite _\"F\u00b7r\u00b7i\u00b7e\u00b7n\u00b7d\u00b7s\" (1994)_ (qv) actor 'Matthew Perry' (qv). The film was a modest hit, and Hayek continued to rise her star in both commercial and artistic films such as: _Breaking Up (1997)_ (qv) with an unknown 'Russell Crowe' (qv); _54 (1998)_ (qv) about the rise and fall of the legendary New York club; _Dogma (1999)_ (qv), playing the muse in a somewhat odd comedy co-starring 'Matt Damon' (qv) and 'Chris Rock' (qv); _In the Time of the Butterflies (2001) (TV)_ (qv), the small artistic film which won Hayek an ALMA award as best actress; and the 1999 summer blockbuster _Wild Wild West (1999)_ (qv). Her production company \"Ventanarosa\" produced the 1999 Mexican feature film _Coronel no tiene quien le escriba, El (1999)_ (qv), which was shown at the Cannes Film Festival and selected as Mexico's official Oscar entry for best foreign film. The new millennium started out quietly around Salma as she was preparing to produce and star in her dream role, that of 'Frida Kahlo' (qv), the legendary Mexican painter whom Salma had been admiring her entire life and whose story she wanted to bring to the big screen ever since her arrival in Hollywood. It finally happened in 2002. _Frida (2002)_ (qv), co-produced by Hayek, was a beautifully made film overflowing with passion and enthusiasm, with terrific performances from Salma and 'Alfred Molina' (qv) as Kahlo's cheating husband \"Diego Rivera\". On the side was an entourage of stars including 'Antonio Banderas' (qv), 'Ashley Judd' (qv), 'Geoffrey Rush' (qv), 'Edward Norton' (qv) and 'Valeria Golino' (qv). The picture was a hit and was nominated for six Oscars, including best actress for Hayek, who became the first Latin actress to be nominated in the category, and won the awards for make-up and its brilliant original score by 'Elliot Goldenthal' (qv). Hayek established herself as the serious actress that she is and, in the same year, expanded her horizons, directing _The Maldonado Miracle (2003) (TV)_ (qv), which was shown at the Sundance Film festival. In 2003, she starred in the final of Rodriguez's \"Desperado\" trilogy _Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003)_ (qv), again opposite Banderas, and has just finished _After the Sunset (2004)_ (qv) opposite 'Pierce Brosnan' (qv) and _Ask the Dust (2006)_ (qv) opposite 'Colin Farrell' (qv). Both are scheduled for release in early 2005. In the works are 'Robert Altman' (qv)'s \"Paint\" and _Bandidas (2006)_ (qv) in which she will star with her friend 'Pen\u00e9lope Cruz' (qv)."}}, {"pk": 297, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:10:39", "birthplace": "Chicago, Illinois, USA", "surname": "Head", "created": "2009-03-10 21:10:39", "image": "", "birthdate": "12 October 1965", "imdb_id": "1529088", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Steve", "height": null, "slug": "steve-head", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 109, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 20:59:45", "birthplace": "Roswell, New Mexico, USA", "surname": "Hector", "created": "2009-03-10 20:59:45", "image": "images/persons/johnnie-hector.jpg", "birthdate": "24 April 1975", "imdb_id": "2094313", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 99, "forename": "Johnnie", "height": 137, "slug": "johnnie-hector", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 61, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 20:57:06", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Herlihy", "created": "2009-03-10 20:57:06", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "2736268", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Carmen M.", "height": null, "slug": "carmen-m-herlihy", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 352, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:16:39", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Hernandez", "created": "2009-03-10 21:16:39", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0379608", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Johnny 'Vatos'", "height": null, "slug": "johnny-vatos-hernandez", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 133, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:00:54", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Hernandez", "created": "2009-03-10 21:00:54", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "2655182", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Milton", "height": null, "slug": "milton-hernandez", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 345, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:16:17", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Hillhouse", "created": "2009-03-10 21:16:17", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0384936", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Brenda", "height": null, "slug": "brenda-hillhouse", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 235, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:07:37", "birthplace": "Illinois, USA", "surname": "Hobson", "created": "2009-03-10 21:07:37", "image": "", "birthdate": "11 August 1935", "imdb_id": "0387734", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "I.M.", "height": null, "slug": "im-hobson", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 316, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:12:09", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Hodge", "created": "2009-03-10 21:12:09", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0388038", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Aldis", "height": null, "slug": "aldis-hodge", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 141, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:01:43", "birthplace": "Fairport, New York, USA", "surname": "Hoffman", "created": "2009-03-10 21:01:43", "image": "images/persons/philip-seymour-hoffman.jpg", "birthdate": "23 July 1967", "imdb_id": "0000450", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "Philip Seymour", "height": 124, "slug": "philip-seymour-hoffman", "biography": "Film and stage actor and theater director 'Philip Seymour Hoffman' (qv) was born in the Rochester, New York, suburb of Fairport on July 23, 1967.

His father, Tabby Thomas is a well-respected blues musician and owner of the famed Baton Rouge blues club Tabby's Blues Box and Heritage Hall. He grew up among the finest blues musicians in the genre at his father's blues club and began touring with artists like Buddy Guy and B. B. King in his teens. His music was not only influenced by the blues, but by early hip-hop and country music, styles he fuses to create his own unique sound. He writes, arranges, sings and plays all instruments on most of his recordings and produces them as well in his New Orleans recording studio. Chris is the most successful blues musician of his generation having sold more than ten million records in the United States. As an entrepreneur, Chris took control of his master recordings in the early 1900s, founding the New Orleans record company 21st Century Blues Records to promote a more authentic image and sound than was promoted at most corporate record labels at the time. He coined and trademarked the phrase \"21st. Century Blues\" in 1993. He owns and manages his own recording studio, 21st. Century Blues Studios, where he produces not only his own music but music for motion pictures. In 2002, 21st. Century Blues Records signed the New Orleans Ninth Ward blues duo the 21CB Boyz (Kipori \"Baby Wolf\" Woods and spoken word artist Myself) and the London, England based Nublues. Chris's latest collection is entitled Live on Beale Street, which was released in April, 2008. As a respected actor and film composer, Chris garnered high praise for his role as Delta blues man Tommy Johnson in his film debut O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000) and won several awards, including Country Music and Grammy Awards for his contribution to the score. He followed up this success with a strong supporting role in the Oscar Winning Ray Charles biopic, Ray, playing band leader Lowell Fulson and scoring the music for the movie with Ray Charles. He played the role of Blind Willie Johnson in the award winning Martin Scorsese PBS series The Blues and has been featured in or produced and starred in a number of other films and documentaries. He plays Detective Storm Anderson, Steven Seagal's police partner, in Kill Switch an action thriller which will be released on DVD October 7, 2008. A record label executive with over fifteen years experience, Chris has not only innovated blues music but the way it is packaged and sold in the new digital record business. Having the vision to see the shift from physical sales to downloading, Chris invested time and money in developing relationships in Los Angeles with Hollywood producers to license music for film and television creating new revenue streams and world wide brand awareness for his 21st. Century Blues label. Co-founder of a non-profit charity, The Blues Project, Chris has helped to raise thousands of dollars for Louisiana Charities and New Orleans musicians affected by Katrina. He also serves as a board member for the Grammy Foundation in Los Angeles. Chris's Blues Project raised $50,000 at a benefit concert in Las Vegas during the CineVagas Film Festival in June of 2008. His next benefit for the Blues Project will be on October 16, 2008 at the House of Blues in New Orleans during the New Orleans Film Festival."}}, {"pk": 169, "model": "movie.person", "fields":

habit of stealing movies with mere moments of screen time. Born and raised in Texas, Lamkin was drawn to performing through her school choir. She continued acting at Texas Women's University before eventually settling in Houston. Many people encouraged Kathy on her artistic journey -- while performing with a traveling theater company, owner Barbara Jenkins mentored Kathy making the transition from stage to film; subsequently, Jo Edna Boldin became one of the first casting directors to recognize her unique talent and cast Kathy in films. While in Texas, she remained active in commercials and theatre, and ran her own company, Unicorn School of Acting and later the performing wing, USA Theatre. At the urging of casting director Terry Berland and agent Kristene Wallis, Lamkin made the move to Los Angeles in 2002. Her first TV role in Hollywood was on \"Malcolm in the Middle\", opposite Jane Kaczmarek. She was extremely grateful to Jane for calling attention to the fact they needed turn around for her close ups. Memorable guest star roles-such as in \"Nip/Tuck\", where she was required to wear a 200-pound fat suit and the aforementioned \"Tea Lady\"-followed, leading to a recent run of high-profile screen roles in films such as: In the Valley of Elah, The Heartbreak Kid, and No Country for Old Men, where she's the only character to stand up to Javier Bardem's psychotic killer and live. Kathy's first screen kiss came from Ben Stiller in The Heartbreak Kid; unfortunately, it didn't make the final cut of the film. Kathy's daughter Kati is a film editor in Los Angeles and her son Greg is a police officer, married with two young children. Her husband, Steve, encourages her while working as an aerospace engineer at NASA. Kathy's father was an oil field wildcatter (exploring for undiscovered oil) and her mother was an artist and business woman."}}, {"pk": 350, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:16:34", "birthplace": "Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico", "surname": "Larriva", "created": "2009-03-10 21:16:34", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0488644", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Tito", "height": null, "slug": "tito-larriva", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 440, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:25:07", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Latham", "created": "2009-03-10 21:25:07", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0490101", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Laurie", "height": null, "slug": "laurie-latham", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 347, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:16:25", "birthplace": "New York City, New York, USA", "surname": "Lawrence", "created": "2009-03-10 21:16:25", "image": "", "birthdate": "17 February 1910", "imdb_id": "0492908", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Marc", "height": null, "slug": "marc-lawrence", "biography": "American character actor who specialized in underworld types, despite a far greater range.

The two appeared in a number of plays, both with Le Galliene's company and with the highly-politicized Group Theatre, before Lawrence was given a film contract with Columbia Pictures. His scarred complexion and brooding appearance made him a natural for heavies, and he played scores of gangsters and mob bosses over the next six decades. Nevertheless, he could turn in fine performances in very different kinds of roles as well, such as his bewildered mountain boy in _The Shepherd of the Hills (1941)_ (qv). Following the Second World War, as anti-Communist fervor gripped America, Lawrence found himself under scrutiny for his political leanings. When called before the House Un-American Activities Committee, he admitted he had once been a member of the Communist Party. The Committee broke down his resolve and he named the names of other Party members. He was blacklisted and departed for Europe, where he continued to make films, often in leading roles. Following the demise of the blacklist, he returned to America and resumed his position as a familiar and talented purveyor of gangland types.

She first stunned mass audiences and critics alike with her Oscar-nominated performance as 'Danielle Bowden' in _Cape Fear (1991)_ (qv). To date, she has worked with some of the most revered directors in the industry: 'Martin Scorsese' (qv), 'Woody Allen' (qv), 'Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m' (qv), 'Oliver Stone' (qv), and 'Garry Marshall' (qv). Most recently, she received an Emmy nomination for her performance in _My Louisiana Sky (2001) (TV)_ (qv). Whether lending dramatic authenticity or a natural comedic flair, Lewis graces her roles with remarkable range and an original and captivating style. Lewis recently co-starred opposite 'Jennifer Lopez' (qv) in the thriller _Enough (2002/I)_ (qv) directed by 'Michael Apted' (qv). Lewis played the best friend of an abused woman who must reclaim her life from her dangerous husband. The part appealed to her because she got to play a \"sweet, vibrant, regular gal,\" she offers. The poignant drama _Hysterical Blindness (2002) (TV)_ (qv) debuted on August 25, 2002, on HBO, in which Lewis stared with 'Uma Thurman' (qv) and 'Gena Rowlands' (qv). Set in the 1980s, the story follows two single, working-class New Jersey women on a bittersweet quest for love and meaning. Based on the play by 'Laura Cahill' (qv), the film is directed by acclaimed filmmaker 'Mira Nair' (qv) and the executive producer is Thurman. _Hysterical Blindness (2002) (TV)_ (qv) was the centerpiece premiere at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. \"I've never seen this female perspective told before with such a true voice,\" says Lewis, who plays a single mother in _Hysterical Blindness (2002) (TV)_ (qv). \"It's raw, heartbreakingly honest and real.\"Lewis went blond for her role in the DreamWorks comedy _Old School (2003)_ (qv), co-starring opposite 'Luke Wilson' (qv), 'Vince Vaughn' (qv), and 'Will Ferrell' (qv) in this story of disenchanted men who try to recapture their college days by starting a fraternity. \"The script was a laugh-out-loud page-turner,\" says Lewis, who plays Wilson's seemingly innocent girlfriend. \"If I was going to be in a rip-roaring boy's comedy, I knew I didn't want to play straight man. I love doing comedy and doing characters, and I made this one a pampered California girl. My scenes with 'Luke Wilson' (qv) are very situational--and that's where the comedy lies. I'm naturally kind of ridiculous. I don't take myself or others too seriously.\" _Old School (2003)_ (qv)) was released in 2003. Lewis is currently filming the feature _Blueberry (2004)_ (qv), based on the French comic book adventures of Western hero Mike Blueberry. She stars alongside 'Michael Madsen' (qv) and French film star 'Vincent Cassel' (qv) in this project directed by 'Jan Kounen' (qv). For her role as a rancher's daughter, Lewis is on horseback for much of the film. \"I used to ride years ago, but I can only hope the fearlessness I had when I was 11 still lives,\" she says. The production is shooting on location in Mexico, Spain, France, and Britain. Lewis recently received an Emmy nomination for her performance in Showtime's _My Louisiana Sky (2001) (TV)_ (qv), a coming-of-age drama set in rural Louisiana in the early 1950s. Lewis plays Dorie Kay, an urbanized working woman who tries to help her 12-year-old niece come to terms with the girl's developmentally challenged parents. Based on the 'Kimberly Willis Holt' (qv) novel, the acclaimed film was directed by 'Adam Arkin' (qv), who won an Emmy for Outstanding Directing, and produced by 'Anthony Edwards' (qv). One of Lewis' most challenging roles to date was Carla Tate, a mentally challenged woman on a journey of independence and self discovery in 'Garry Marshall' (qv)'s _The Other Sister (1999)_ (qv). \"I wanted to capture her honesty so people could relate to her,\" says Lewis, who starred with her longtime friend 'Giovanni Ribisi' (qv), as well as 'Diane Keaton' (qv) and 'Tom Skerritt' (qv). \"I was playing a character who was full of life and determination, and it really had an effect on me. I connected very deeply to Carla and her feelings.\"Other recent projects include the colorful European comedy release of _Room to Rent (2000)_ (qv), in which Lewis sings and dances as a 'Marilyn Monroe' (qv) impersonator; the crime thriller _The Way of the Gun (2000)_ (qv), starring 'Benicio Del Toro' (qv) and 'Ryan Phillippe' (qv); and _Picture Claire (2001)_ (qv), a mockumentary about the making of a big-budget film, with 'Gina Gershon' (qv). Lewis was born in Hollywood to Glenis Batley, a graphic designer, and actor 'Geoffrey Lewis' (qv), a regular in 'Clint Eastwood' (qv)'s films and frontman of the musical group Celestial Navigations. By the age of 6, she knew she wanted to be a performer and found inspiration in musicals like _Fame (1980)_ (qv) and _Grease (1978)_ (qv). At 12, Lewis landed her first leading role in the Showtime miniseries _Home Fires (1987) (TV)_ (qv). After appearing in the sitcoms _\"The Wonder Years\" (1988)_ (qv) and _\"I Married Dora\" (1987)_ (qv), she went on to star with 'Chevy Chase' (qv) in National Lampoon's _Christmas Vacation (1989)_ (qv) and with 'Jennifer Jason Leigh' (qv) in the drama _Crooked Hearts (1991)_ (qv). At 16, Lewis starred in the critically acclaimed telefilm _Too Young to Die? (1990) (TV)_ (qv), based on the true story of Amanda Sue Bradley, a sexually abused runaway who was the first minor to receive the death sentence. Lewis' performance caught the attention of 'Martin Scorsese' (qv), who cast her in the thriller _Cape Fear (1991)_ (qv). Her powerful scenes with 'Robert De Niro' (qv) captured the quiet complexities of adolescence and earned her an Oscar nomination and Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Her auditorium scene with De Niro goes down in movie-making history as one of cinema's classic scenes. Lewis next worked with 'Woody Allen' (qv) in _Husbands and Wives (1992)_ (qv), playing a self-assured college coed who has a penchant for older men, particularly her married professor. She then went on to star in the bittersweet love story _That Night (1992)_ (qv), with 'C. Thomas Howell' (qv). In 1993, Lewis starred as Adele Corners, a dysfunctional innocent on a cross-country journey with her psycho-killer boyfriend ('Brad Pitt' (qv)) in _Kalifornia (1993)_ (qv). She also played a waitress from Queens opposite 'Gary Oldman' (qv) in _Romeo Is Bleeding (1993)_ (qv) and a wise and worldly young drifter in _What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)_ (qv) with 'Johnny Depp' (qv) and 'Leonardo DiCaprio' (qv). In 1994, Lewis starred alongside 'Woody Harrelson' (qv) in _Natural Born Killers (1994)_ (qv), 'Oliver Stone' (qv)'s controversial media satire about two mass murderers who become legendary folk heroes. Lewis's other credits include the 'Nora Ephron' (qv) comedy _Mixed Nuts (1994)_ (qv) with 'Steve Martin' (qv) and 'Adam Sandler' (qv); the sci-fi action film _Strange Days (1995)_ (qv) with 'Ralph Fiennes' (qv) and 'Angela Bassett' (qv); and 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv)'s vampire tale _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv) with 'George Clooney' (qv). In 1996, Lewis appeared as 'Shirley MacLaine' (qv)'s granddaughter in _The Evening Star (1996)_ (qv). She went on to star in the independent film _Some Girl (1998)_ (qv), with 'Michael Rapaport' (qv) and 'Giovanni Ribisi' (qv), and the thriller _The 4th Floor (1999)_ (qv) with 'William Hurt' (qv). Lewis has been married since 1999 to professional skateboarder 'Stephen Berra' (qv) but has filed for divorce."}}, {"pk": 271, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:09:28", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Lichtenstein", "created": "2009-03-10 21:09:28", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0509042", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Stan", "height": null, "slug": "stan-lichtenstein", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 292, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:10:26", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Lillard", "created": "2009-03-10 21:10:26", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0510326", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Ed", "height": null, "slug": "ed-lillard", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 369, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:17:24", "birthplace": "Pennsylvania, USA", "surname": "Liszewski", "created": "2009-03-10 21:17:24", "image": "", "birthdate": "????", "imdb_id": "0514303", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Janie", "height": null, "slug": "janie-liszewski", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 391, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:18:46", "birthplace": "Guangdong, China", "surname": "Liu", "created": "2009-03-10 21:18:46", "image": "", "birthdate": "30 November 1955", "imdb_id": "0514904", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Chia Hui", "height": null, "slug": "chia-hui-liu", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 338, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:15:47", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Liu", "created": "2009-03-10 21:15:47", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0514918", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Ernest", "height": null, "slug": "ernest-liu", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 383, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:18:17", "birthplace": "Queens, New York, USA", "surname": "Liu", "created": "2009-03-10 21:18:17", "image": "images/persons/lucy-liu.jpg", "birthdate": "2 December 1968", "imdb_id": "0005154", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 99, "forename": "Lucy", "height": 134, "slug": "lucy-liu", "biography": "Born to Chinese immigrants in Queens, New York, 'Lucy Liu' (qv) has always tried to balance an interest in her cultural heritage with a desire to move beyond a strictly Asian-American experience. Once relegated to \"ethnic\" parts, the energetic actress is finally earning her stripes as an across-the-board leading lady. Liu graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1986 and enrolled in New York University; discouraged by the \"dark and sarcastic\" atmosphere of NYU, however, she transferred to the University of Michigan after her freshman year. She graduated from UM with a degree in Chinese Language and Culture, managing to squeeze in some additional training in dance, voice, fine arts, and acting. During her senior year, Liu auditioned for a small part in a production of Alice in Wonderland and walked away with the lead; encouraged by the experience, she decided to take the plunge into professional acting. She moved to Los Angeles and split her time between auditions and food service day jobs, eventually scoring a guest appearance as a waitress on _\"Beverly Hills, 90210\" (1990)_ (qv). That performance led to more walk-on parts in shows like _\"NYPD Blue\" (1993)_ (qv), _\"ER\" (1994)_ (qv), and _\"The X Files\" (1993)_ (qv). In 1996, she was cast as an ambitious college student on 'Rhea Perlman' (qv)'s ephemeral sitcom _\"Pearl\" (1996)_ (qv). Liu first appeared on the big screen as an ex-girlfriend in _Jerry Maguire (1996)_ (qv) (she had previously filmed a scene in the indie _Bang (1995)_ (qv), but it was shelved for two years). She then waded through a series of supporting parts in small films before landing her big break on _\"Ally McBeal\" (1997)_ (qv). Liu initially auditioned for the role of Nelle Porter, which went to 'Portia de Rossi' (qv), but writer-producer 'David E. Kelley' (qv) was so impressed with her spunk that he promised to write a part for her in an upcoming episode. The part turned out to be that of growling, ill-tempered lawyer Ling Woo, which Liu filled with such aplomb that she was signed on as a regular cast member. The \"Ally\" win gave Liu's film career a much-needed boost--in 1999, she was cast as a dominatrix in the 'Mel Gibson' (qv) action flick _Payback (1999)_, and as a hitchhiker in the ill-received boxing saga _Play It to the Bone (1999)_ (qv). The next year brought even larger roles: first as the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei in 'Jackie Chan' (qv)'s western _Shanghai Noon (2000)_ (qv), then as one-third of the comely crime-fighting trio in _Charlie's Angels (2000)_ (qv). When she's not hissing at clients or throwing well-coiffed punches, Liu keeps busy with an eclectic mix of off-screen hobbies. She practices the martial art of Kali-Eskrima-Silat (knife-and-stick fighting), skis, rock climbs, rides horses, and plays the accordion. In 1993 she exhibited a collection of multimedia art pieces at the Cast Iron Gallery in SoHo (New York), after which she won a grant to study and create art in China. Her hectic schedule doesn't leave much time for romantic intrigue, but Liu says she prefers to keep that side of her life uncluttered."}}, {"pk": 270, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:09:26", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Loch", "created": "2009-03-10 21:09:26", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0516628", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Philip", "height": null, "slug": "philip-loch", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 194, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:05:06", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Locke", "created": "2009-03-10 21:05:06", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0516749", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "John", "height": null, "slug": "john-locke", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 33, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 20:47:05", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Lomax", "created": "2009-03-10 20:47:05", "image": "images/persons/david-s-lomax.jpg", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0518257", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "David S.", "height": 125, "slug": "david-s-lomax", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 398, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:19:09", "birthplace": "USA", "surname": "Loughran", "created": "2009-03-10 21:19:09", "image": "", "birthdate": "1966", "imdb_id": "0521781", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Jonathan", "height": null, "slug": "jonathan-loughran", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 103, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 20:59:30", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Love", "created": "2009-03-10 20:59:30", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "2655195", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Chip", "height": null, "slug": "chip-love", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 381, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:17:55", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Lucai", "created": "2009-03-10 21:17:55", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0524029", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Victoria", "height": null, "slug": "victoria-lucai", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 23, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 20:46:38", "birthplace": "Boulder, Colorado, USA", "surname": "Lynch", "created": "2009-03-10 20:46:38", "image": "images/persons/john-carroll-lynch.jpg", "birthdate": "1 August 1963", "imdb_id": "0002253", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "John Carroll", "height": 137, "slug": "john-carroll-lynch", "biography": "'John Carroll Lynch' (qv) was born August 1st, 1963 in Boulder, Colorado.

From then, he continued to work in theatre around the country, but concentrated mostly on his work at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, acting in many plays from Shakespeare to Shaw to Chekhov. In the early nineties, John was able to find time away from the theatre to work in film, as productions came through Minnesota. In 1996, he received critical acclaim for his role as Marge Gunderson's simple husband Norm Gunderson in _Fargo (1996)_ (qv). He went on to make two more films that year, both of which were conveniently set in Minnesota, the acclaimed _Beautiful Girls (1996)_ (qv) and _Feeling Minnesota (1996)_ (qv).

From his recent roles as Hinh, a deadly efficient assassin and nationalist spy masquerading as 'Michael Caine' (qv)'s ever-invaluable assistant in _The Quiet American (2002)_ (qv) to his hilarious, lit-cigarette-swallowing take as The General in 'Joel Coen' (qv) and 'Ethan Coen' (qv)'s _The Ladykillers (2004)_ (qv), Ma always delivers the unexpected. So far, 2005 is offering Ma even more opportunities to brand his indelible stamp on widely diverse projects. This year will see him in a slate of shows, including a multi-episode cliffhanger for the critically acclaimed hit series _\"24\" (2001)_ (qv); the inspirational Lions Gate family drama _Akeelah and the Bee (2006)_ (qv); 'Nick Cassavetes' (qv)' _Alpha Dog (2006)_ (qv); the indie experimental film by new filmmaker 'Juwan Chung' (qv), _Baby (2003/I)_ (qv), in which Ma will also function as associate producer; an episode of _\"JAG\" (1995)_ (qv) that aired in the spring, and the indie movie _Red Doors (2005)_ (qv), which premiered at the Fourth Annual Tribeca Film Festival and won for best narrative feature made in New York. _Red Doors (2005)_ (qv) is the work of writer/director 'Georgia Lee' (qv), who served as director 'Martin Scorsese' (qv)'s apprentice on the set of _Gangs of New York (2002)_ (qv) in Rome. She approached Ma to play the part of vulnerable, emotionally bankrupt father Ed Wong, who is desperately trying to mask his incessant suicidal compulsions from his three grown daughters. On the pulse-accelerating season closer for _\"24\" (2001)_ (qv), Ma is the main protagonist, the relentless head of security for the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles. Shedding his diplomatic correctness to go eyeball to eyeball against 'Kiefer Sutherland' (qv)'s Agent Jack Bauer, Ma's character engages in a searing, deadly duel of wit, intimidation and lies. In _Baby (2003/I)_ (qv) and _Akeelah and the Bee (2006)_ (qv), starring 'Laurence Fishburne' (qv) and 'Angela Bassett' (qv), Ma again interprets fatherhood, first as an intensely competitive \"sports dad\" driving his small son to win at any cost, then as an alcoholic who sees his son embracing a similar path of failure and waste. It was a personal invitation from director Cassavetes that led to Ma's cameo in _Alpha Dog (2006)_ (qv), based on the headline-grabbing activities of Jesse James Hollywood, an alleged drug dealer accused of masterminding a kidnap-murder. 'Tzi Ma' (qv) was born in Hong Kong and raised in New York City. Surrounded by music, diverse cultures, and an eclectic lifestyle, he defied tradition to study classical theater and dance. Drive and versatility resulted in steady stage and film work and since that time he has appeared in such television series as _\"The Practice\" (1997)_ (qv), _\"JAG\" (1995)_ (qv), _\"The Bernie Mac Show\" (2001)_ (qv), _\"Chicago Hope\" (1994)_ (qv), _\"Millennium\" (1996/I)_ (qv), _\"Jake 2.0\" (2003)_ (qv), _\"Martial Law\" (1998)_ (qv), _\"ER\" (1994)_ (qv), _\"Law & Order\" (1990)_ (qv), _\"Boomtown\" (2002)_ (qv), as the star of the series _\"Yellowthread Street\" (1990)_ (qv), and in the popular recurring role of Det. Harold Ng on _\"NYPD Blue\" (1993)_ (qv). His numerous feature films include _Rush Hour (1998)_ (qv), _Golden Gate (1998)_ (qv), _Dante's Peak (1997)_ (qv), _Rapid Fire (1992)_ (qv), _Chain Reaction (1996)_ (qv), and the acclaimed indie feature _Catfish in Black Bean Sauce (1999)_ (qv). On stage, he garnered critical and popular acclaim with his starring role of \"Master Wang/Sammy Fong\" in the revised version of \"Flower Drum Song\" by 'David Henry Hwang' (qv), at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. Ma also appeared in two plays written especially for him, \"The Dance and The Railroad,\" by Tony award-winning playwright Hwang (M. Butterfly) and \"In Perpetuity Throughout The Universe\" by 'Eric Overmyer' (qv) (executive producer of _\"Law & Order\" (1990)_ (qv)). Ma has received numerous awards and nominations for his work, including the Cine Golden Eagle Award for Best Actor in \"The Dance and The Railroad\"; an Ace Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in _The Forgotten (2004)_ (qv), a TV film directed by 'James Keach' (qv); a Dramalogue Best\"Choreographer/Best Director Award for \"The Dance and The Railroad\"; and a Garland Award nomination for Best Actor, as well as a Los Angeles City Council Citation, for \"Flower Drum Song.\" Ma maintains homes in New York and Los Angeles."}}, {"pk": 93, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 20:58:55", "birthplace": "Glasgow, Scotland, UK", "surname": "Macdonald", "created": "2009-03-10 20:58:55", "image": "images/persons/kelly-macdonald.jpg", "birthdate": "23 February 1976", "imdb_id": "0531808", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "Kelly", "height": 137, "slug": "kelly-macdonald", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 3, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 20:45:37", "birthplace": "Miami, Florida, USA", "surname": "Macy", "created": "2009-03-10 20:45:37", "image": "images/persons/william-h-macy.jpg", "birthdate": "13 March 1950", "imdb_id": "0000513", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "William H.", "height": 140, "slug": "william-h-macy", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 387, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:24:09", "birthplace": "Chicago, Illinois, USA", "surname": "Madsen", "created": "2009-03-10 21:18:34", "image": "images/persons/michael-madsen.jpg", "birthdate": "25 September 1958", "imdb_id": "0000514", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "Michael", "height": 133, "slug": "michael-madsen", "biography": "At 6' 2\" and 190 pounds, 'Michael Madsen' (qv) - the brother of actress 'Virginia Madsen' (qv) - is equally adept at portraying heroic as well as villainous characters.

Madsen first learned his craft at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre, where he worked under 'John Malkovich' (qv), one of the theater's founders. His first few film roles were minor ones, in such projects as _Against All Hope (1982)_ (qv), _Racing with the Moon (1984)_ (qv) and _The Natural (1984)_ (qv). His work received considerable notice, however, after his knife-edged performance as deranged killer Vince Miller in _Kill Me Again (1989)_ (qv) and then as 'Susan Sarandon' (qv)'s rough-edged boyfriend Jimmy in _Thelma & Louise (1991)_ (qv). His big breakthrough, however, came as the sadistic jewel thief Mr. Blonde in 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv)'s low-budget hit _Reservoir Dogs (1992)_ (qv). Movie audiences were glued to their seats as Madsen playfully danced around a tied-down and terrified police officer, slicing him with a knife and splashing gasoline all over the petrified man, all to the cheery tunes of \"Stealer's Wheels' \"Stuck In the Middle With You.\" Not to be typecast, Madsen surprised many with his performance as foster parent Glen Greenwood in the hit family movie _Free Willy (1993)_ (qv) before returning to another criminal role as bank robber Rudy Travis in the remake of the 'Steve McQueen' (qv) heist flick _The Getaway (1994)_ (qv), and then back again as Glen Greenwood in _Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (1995)_ (qv). Madsen continues to turn in edge-of-the-seat performances as morally bankrupt individuals on the wrong side of the law, as in his intense on-screen showings in _Donnie Brasco (1997)_ (qv), _Mulholland Falls (1996)_ (qv), and _High Noon (2000) (TV)_ (qv). In 2003 he teamed up again with Tarantino in both \"volumes\" of Tarantino's magnum martial arts/revenge opus _Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)_ (qv) and _Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)_ (qv) as the coldly evil Budd (aka \"Sidewinder\"). In addition to his film work, Madsen has contributed dialogue to two of Sony PlayStations's biggest-selling games, _Grand Theft Auto III (2001) (VG)_ (qv) and _Driv3r (2004) (VG)_ (qv), as well as writing several books of his own poetry.

in Fayetteville, North Carolina on December 3, 1960. She spent the early years of her life in over two dozen locations around the world with her parents before she finally found her place at Boston University, where she earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree in acting from the School of the Performing Arts. After graduation (in 1983), Julianne moved to New York and worked extensively in theater, including appearances off-Broadway in two Caryl Churchill plays, Serious Money and Ice Cream With Hot Fudge and as Ophelia in Hamlet at The Guthrie Theatre. But despite her formal training, Julianne fell into the attractive actress' trap of the mid-1980's: TV soaps and miniseries. She appeared briefly in the daytime serial _\"The Edge of Night\" (1956)_ (qv) and from 1985 to 1988 she played two half-sisters Frannie and Sabrina on the soap _\"As the World Turns\" (1956)_ (qv). This performance later led to an Outstanding Ing\u00e9nue Daytime Emmy Award in 1988. Her subsequent appearances were in mostly forgettable TV-movies, such as _Money, Power, Murder. (1989) (TV)_ (qv), _The Last to Go (1991) (TV)_ (qv) and _Cast a Deadly Spell (1991) (TV)_ (qv). She made her entrance into the big screen with 1990's _Tales from the Darkside: The Movie (1990)_ (qv), where she played the victim of a mummy. Two years later, Julianne appeared in feature films with supporting parts in _The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (1992)_ (qv) and the comedy _The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag (1992)_ (qv). She kept winning better and more powerful roles as time went on, including a small but memorable role as 'Harrison Ford' (qv)'s colleague in _The Fugitive (1993)_ (qv). (A role that made such an impression on 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) that he cast her in the _Jurassic Park (1993)_ (qv) sequel without an audition in 1997). In one of Moore's most distinguished performances, she recapitulated her \"beguiling Yelena\" from 'Andre Gregory' (qv)'s workshop version of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya in 'Louis Malle' (qv)'s critically acclaimed _Vanya on 42nd Street (1994)_ (qv). Director 'Todd Haynes' (qv) gave Julianne her first opportunity to take on a lead role in _Safe (1995)_ (qv). Her portrayal of Carol White, an affluent L.A. housewife who develops an inexplicable allergic reaction to her environment, won critical praise as well as an Independent Spirit Award nomination. Later that year she found her way into romantic comedy, co-starring as 'Hugh Grant' (qv)'s pregnant girlfriend in _Nine Months (1995)_ (qv). Following films included _Assassins (1995)_ (qv), where she played an electronics security expert targeted for death (next to 'Sylvester Stallone' (qv) and 'Antonio Banderas' (qv)) and _Surviving Picasso (1996)_ (qv), where she played Dora Maar, one of the numerous lovers of Picasso (portrayed by her hero, 'Anthony Hopkins' (qv)). A year later, after co-starring in Spielberg's _The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)_ (qv), opposite 'Jeff Goldblum' (qv), a young and unknown director, 'Paul Thomas Anderson' (qv) asked Julianne to appear in his movie, _Boogie Nights (1997)_ (qv). Despite her misgivings, she finally was won over by the script and her decision to play the role of Amber Waves, a loving porn star who acts as a mother figure to a ragtag crew, proved to be a wise one, since she received both Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. Julianne started 1998 by playing an erotic artist in _The Big Lebowski (1998)_ (qv), continued with a small role in the social comedy _Chicago Cab (1997)_ (qv) and ended with a subtle performance in 'Gus Van Sant' (qv)'s remake of _Psycho (1960)_ (qv). 1999 had Moore as busy as an actress can be. She starred in a number of high-profile projects, beginning with 'Robert Altman' (qv)'s _Cookie's Fortune (1999)_ (qv) , in which she was cast as the mentally challenged but adorable sister of a decidedly unhinged 'Glenn Close' (qv). A portrayal of the scheming Mrs. Cheveley followed in 'Oliver Parker' (qv)'s _An Ideal Husband (1999)_ (qv) with a number of critics asserting that Moore was the best part of the movie. She then enjoyed another collaboration with director Anderson in _Magnolia (1999)_ (qv) and continued with an outstanding performance in _The End of the Affair (1999)_ (qv), for which she garnered another Oscar nomination. She ended 1999 with another great performance, that of a grieving mother in _A Map of the World (1999)_ (qv), opposite 'Sigourney Weaver' (qv)."}}, {"pk": 118, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:00:13", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Moore", "created": "2009-03-10 21:00:13", "image": "images/persons/trent-moore.jpg", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "2278936", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 94, "forename": "Trent", "height": 140, "slug": "trent-moore", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 399, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:19:11", "birthplace": "Tokyo, Japan", "surname": "Morishita", "created": "2009-03-10 21:19:11", "image": "", "birthdate": "4 December 1962", "imdb_id": "0605676", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Yoshiyuki", "height": null, "slug": "yoshiyuki-morishita", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 358, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:16:58", "birthplace": "El Paso, Texas, USA", "surname": "Moroff", "created": "2009-03-10 21:16:58", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0120878", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Mike", "height": null, "slug": "mike-moroff", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 73, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 20:57:41", "birthplace": "Alexandria, Virginia, USA", "surname": "Mulroney", "created": "2009-03-10 20:57:41", "image": "images/persons/dermot-mulroney.jpg", "birthdate": "31 October 1963", "imdb_id": "0000551", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 97, "forename": "Dermot", "height": 140, "slug": "dermot-mulroney", "biography": "'Dermot Mulroney' (qv) grew up in Alexandria, Virginia, and went to Maury Elementary School.

He acted in grade school and high school plays and after being disharged from the navy in 1946 enrolled at Kenyon College. After graduation he spent a year at the Yale Drama School and then headed to New York, where he attended the famed New York Actors Studio. Classically handsome and with a super abundance of sex appeal, television parts came easily and, after his first Broadway appearance in \"Picnic\" (1953), he was offered a movie contract by Warner Brothers. His first film, _The Silver Chalice (1954)_ (qv) was nearly his last. He considered his performance in this costume epic to be so bad that he took out a full-page ad in a trade paper apologizing for it to anyone who might have seen it. He fared much better in his next effort, _Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956)_ (qv), in which he portrayed boxer 'Rocky Graziano' (qv) and drew raves from the critics for his briliant performance. He went on to become one of the top box office draws of the 1960s, starring in such superior films as _The Hustler (1961)_ (qv), _The Prize (1963)_ (qv), _Hud (1963)_ (qv), _Cool Hand Luke (1967)_ (qv) and _Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)_ (qv). He also produced and directed many quality films, including _Rachel, Rachel (1968)_ (qv) in which he directed wife 'Joanne Woodward' (qv) and which received an Oscar nomination for best picture. Nominated nine times for a best actor Oscar, he finally took one home for his performance as an aging pool shark in _The Color of Money (1986)_ (qv). Though well into his 70s as the century drew to a close, Newman still commanded lead roles in films such as _Message in a Bottle (1999)_ (qv). He lives with his wife in Westport, Connecticut. A caring and supremely generous man, he is the founder of \"Newman's Own\" a successful line of food products that has earned in excess of $100 million, every penny of which the philanthropic movie icon has donated to charity. Renowned for his sense of humor, in 1998 he quipped that he was a little embarrassed to see his salad dressing grossing more than his movies."}}, {"pk": 356, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:16:52", "birthplace": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA", "surname": "Nicotero", "created": "2009-03-10 21:16:52", "image": "", "birthdate": "15 March 1963", "imdb_id": "0630524", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Gregory", "height": null, "slug": "gregory-nicotero", "biography": "Gifted SFX and make-up wizard, who learned his trade under the watchful eye of SFX splatter guru 'Tom Savini' (qv).

Born in Modesto, California in 1933, he graduated from Modesto High School and initially trained for an operatic career. He was performing nationally when the opportunity for Broadway first came his way. Legendary composer 'Meredith Willson' (qv) happened to catch an earful of the gifted singer in concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles and, in the virile mold of an 'Alfred Drake' (qv) or 'Howard Keel' (qv), wrote the role of Johnny \"Leadville\" Brown in \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" specifically for him as a showcase. The Broadway musical, with 'Tammy Grimes' (qv) as the spunky title heroine, was a resounding hit while Harve wrapped his glorious tonsils around such sturdy, wide-stanced songs as \"Colorado, My Home\" and \"I'll Never Say No.\" Unlike Grimes, Presnell managed to recreate his part when the celluloid version of _The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964)_ (qv) came out with a certifiable film star, the indomitable 'Debbie Reynolds' (qv), inhabiting the backwoods role. The film version was also hugely popular with audiences. It seemed like a star was about to be born but there were precious few movie musicals for Presnell to sink his teeth into and he quickly faded into the woodwork. He tried adjusting to straight dramatics with the rugged western _The Glory Guys (1965)_ (qv) and sang again in the highly unworthy teen frolic _When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965)_ (qv) with 'Connie Francis' (qv), but little else came his way. The disastrous film version of _Paint Your Wagon (1969)_ (qv) starring the highly miscast 'Lee Marvin' (qv), 'Clint Eastwood' (qv) and 'Jean Seberg' (qv), was redeemed only by the presence of Presnell and his superb rendition of \"They Call the Wind Mariah.\"By the 70s he was finished in films and was relegated to Keel-like stock and tour roles in such productions as \"Annie Get Your Gun\" (as Frank Butler) and \"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,\" among others. He even played Rhett Butler in a musical version of \"Gone With the Wind\" at London's Drury Lane Theatre, but did not generate much of a stir. In 1979, Presnell served as a replacement in the Broadway musical \"Annie\" as Daddy Warbucks and stayed with the role for years on tour, also reprising the tycoon in the failed 90s sequel \"Annie II: Miss Hannigan's Revenge,\" which was later retitled \"Annie Warbucks.\"More than 25 years had passed by the time Presnell returned to the movies as a brash and balding character actor. He struck pure gold as the righteous, dominating, ill-fated father-in-law of 'William H. Macy' (qv) in the Coen Brothers' cult film hit _Fargo (1996)_ (qv). This success, in turn, led to meaty roles in _Larger Than Life (1996)_ (qv), _The Whole Wide World (1996)_ (qv), _The Chamber (1996)_ (qv), _Face/Off (1997)_ (qv), _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv) and _The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)_ (qv), to name a few. Over the course of his career, he has proven himself a strong presence on TV as well with recurring roles on prime-time (\"Lois & Clark\") and daytime (\"Ryan's Hope\"). Presnell may have been born 10-20 years too late to have become a singing film star, but he has come back in spades to launch a whole new career as a noted character performer. Recent roles at age 70+ include TV's \"The Pretender,\" \"The Monk\" and \"ER,\" and the films _Mr. Deeds (2002)_ (qv) and _Old School (2003)_ (qv), indicate there are no signs that the twice-married actor is interested in slowing down."}}, {"pk": 348, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:16:29", "birthplace": "Honolulu, Hawaii, USA", "surname": "Preston", "created": "2009-03-10 21:16:29", "image": "images/persons/kelly-preston.jpg", "birthdate": "13 October 1962", "imdb_id": "0000593", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "Kelly", "height": 137, "slug": "kelly-preston", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 258, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:08:47", "birthplace": "Royal Oak, Michigan, USA", "surname": "Raimi", "created": "2009-03-10 21:08:47", "image": "images/persons/sam-raimi.jpg", "birthdate": "23 October 1959", "imdb_id": "0000600", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "Sam", "height": 126, "slug": "sam-raimi", "biography": "Highly inventive US film director/producer/writer/actor 'Sam Raimi' (qv) first came to the attention of film fans with the savage, yet darkly humorous, low-budget horror film _The Evil Dead (1981)_ (qv). From his childhood Raimi was a fan of the cinema and before he was ten years old, he was out making movies with an 8mm camera. He was a devoted fan of 'The Three Stooges' (qv), so much of Raimi's film work in his teens, with good friends 'Bruce Campbell' (qv) and 'Robert G. Tapert' (qv), was slapstick comedy based around what they had observed from Stooges movies. Among the three of them they wrote, directed, produced and edited a short horror movie titled _Within the Woods (1978)_ (qv), which was then shown to prospective investors to raise the money necessary to film _The Evil Dead (1981)_ (qv). It met with lukewarm interest in the US with local distributors, so Raimi took the film to Europe, where it was much more warmly received. After it started gaining positive reviews and, more importantly, ticket sales upon its release in Europe, US distributors showed renewed interest, and \"Evil Dead\" was eventually released stateside to strong box office returns. His next directorial effort was _Crimewave (1985)_ (qv), a quirky, cartoon-like effort that failed to catch fire with audiences. However, he bounced back with _Evil Dead II (1987)_ (qv), a racier and more humorous remake/sequel to the original \"Dead\" that did even better at the box office. Raimi was then given his biggest budget to date to shoot _Darkman (1990)_ (qv), a comic book-style fantasy about a scarred avenger. The film did moderate business, but Raimi's strong visual style was evident throughout the film via inventive and startling camera work that caught the attention of numerous critics. The third chapter in the Evil Dead story beckoned, and Raimi once again directed buddy Campbell as the gritty hero \"Ash\", in the Gothic horror _Army of Darkness (1993)_. Raimi surprised fans when he took a turn away from the fantasy genre and directed 'Gene Hackman' (qv) and 'Sharon Stone' (qv) in the sexy western _The Quick and the Dead (1995)_ (qv); four years later he took the directorial reins on _A Simple Plan (1998)_ (qv), a crime thriller about stolen money starring 'Bill Paxton' (qv) and 'Bridget Fonda' (qv). In early 1999 he directed the baseball film _For Love of the Game (1999)_ (qv) and in 2000 returned to the fantasy genre with a top-flight cast in _The Gift (2000)_ (qv). In 2002 Raimi was given a real opportunity to demonstrate his dynamic visual style with the big-budget film adaptation of the 'Stan Lee' (qv) comic book superhero _Spider-Man (2002)_ (qv), and fans were not disappointed. The movie was strong in both script and effects, and was a runaway success at the box office. Of course, Raimi returned for the sequel, _Spider-Man 2 (2004)_ (qv), which surpassed the original in box-office takings. Raimi remains one of Hollywood's most creative, exciting and intelligent filmmakers."}}, {"pk": 202, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:05:25", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Rainer", "created": "2009-03-10 21:05:25", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0707002", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Georgia Rae", "height": null, "slug": "georgia-rae-rainer", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 120, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:00:19", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Rains", "created": "2009-03-10 21:00:19", "image": "images/persons/luce-rains.jpg", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0366890", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 79, "forename": "Luce", "height": 140, "slug": "luce-rains", "biography": "'Luce Rains' (qv) grew up on a horse farm in Lexington, Kentucky.

It was a Huck Finn reality. In the mid-sixties his parents moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico where he continued to muck corrals. His mom, thinking he needed a little artistic activity, enrolled him in the local theatre company and he began to play a few roles. When it came time to go to college he auditioned for and was accepted on a scholarship at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri which had a conservatory program - students working with faculty -- and he developed some acting chops while working in the cafeteria for a few extra bucks.

His first acting role on screen came in 'George A. Romero' (qv)'s cult horror classic _Monkey Shines (1988)_ (qv).

The show also introduced him to comedian 'Andy Dick' (qv), one of many comedian-actors whom he would work with again later in the 1990s and beyond. The show ran from 1995 to 1999 before it was canceled. Besides the character of Jimmy James on _\"NewsRadio\" (1995)_ (qv), Root has played more eccentric characters in recent years. Root began voicing several characters in the hit animated TV series _\"King of the Hill\" (1997)_ (qv), a show created by and starring 'Mike Judge' (qv). Judge would later cast Root in another cult classic film, 1999's _Office Space (1999)_ (qv), where Root played the squirrelly and unforgettable Milton Waddams, a man who is pushed around at work and has a fetish for Swingline staplers.

He is a creative genius who is able reach deep inside his soul to bare the imagination that lies within us but few of us are able to tap into. 'Patrick Michael Strange' (qv) was born on November 9, 1977 in San Diego, California. He is the first of two children; his younger sister is Michelle Lynn Strange. His father, Samuel Arthur Strange, is a retired US Navy sailor hailing from San Francisco, California; while his mother, Dianalyn Llamado Fiandler, was born in Cavite City, Philippines. At an early age, while learning to read and write, he already showed inclinations of creativity. He astounded his family and friends with his pencil drawings and other artistic creations. He played dress-up frequently and acted out characters such as Zorro and Batman. As the son of a military man, Patrick and his family traveled frequently. After leaving San Diego, he lived in Sigonella, Sicily (Italy); Winter Harbor, Maine; Goose Creek, South Carolina; Gulfport, Mississippi and Port Orchard, Washington. With all these moves, friendships were lost and life grew further difficult for him. To help with the transitions, friends became the characters in the books that Patrick read and were ones that he could always take with him. Book after book was gobbled up with intensity. Later, a love for art arrived that eventually melded these passions in the form of comic books. Patrick grew an immense love & appreciation for the sequential art form. Adding to the mix, the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy and films such as Indiana Jones and E.T. opened his eyes to even deeper imagination and storytelling... the world of cinema. Born of mixed heritage (Filipino, Irish & German), his upbringing was also a search for identity that would eventually become his greatest strength and motivation. From youth to teen years, where-in race and social classification grows rampant, his \"outsider\" persona - being that he was always the new kid in school and even simpler \"different\" race-wise, kept him out of many things. However undeterred by the ignorance of others, books helped him find the meaning of his self and a social awareness of others. He developed an appreciation for history and knowledge. Sir Francis Bacon's quote, \"Knowledge is power\" is one of his favorites. Reading bore into him a deeper world view and an optimistic vision of the future and along with his creativity a desire to entertain as well as educate in art, comics, photography and film. While in school, Patrick began his first pursuits into comics, music and film. He submitted his art portfolio at comics shows and conventions and was selected for a gifted arts program. Throughout his school years, he participated in Concert Choir and was selected as a Tenor to the All-County Choir. In his junior year, he took up drama and performed in the Mr. Goose Creek High School pageant. It was through this performance, that he was selected to work on the film, \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\" the sequel to the first film, \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\" starring Jim Carrey. In the film, Patrick was a background actor playing a Tibetan monk. In 1996, he graduated from Goose Creek High School and enlisted in the US Navy along with his best friend, Mike Agojo. While at boot camp in Great Lakes, Illinois, Patrick grew upset with his decision to enlist, due to scholarship offers he had turned down. Patrick later credited his military experience to further opening his eyes to the world and strengthening his relationship with his father; whom he grew despondent to in his youth. After boot camp, Patrick attended Yeoman school in Meridien, Mississippi and Submarine School in New London/Groton, Connecticut. His first duty station was onboard the USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG 58) aka the \"Sammy B.\"; whose homeport was located in Norfolk, Virginia. While onboard the \"Sammy B.\", Patrick served two deployments out in the Persian Gulf region. During his first deployment, the pressures of life and his current situation took its toll. While on watch, Patrick nearly committed suicide out on the flight deck. In this lowest moment of life, he found his meaning and threw the knife into the water. In 1999, Patrick met Ebony Braxton, whom would later become his wife; and in 2000, Patrick was honorably discharged and found the freedom to finally pursue his goals and dreams. 2001 birthed Temple Far East Entertainment (Temple Studios and Far East Productions), Patrick's media company and dream realized. First, came the hip hop mix tape CDs featuring popular artists and his undiscovered talented friends, and then his first self-published comic, Blood of Onyx, debuted at the Baltimore Comicon in Baltimore, Maryland. The success of Blood of Onyx led to Patrick's autobiographical comic, The Adventures of Thong Raider and a selection as a contributing comic creator to Sky Dog Press' Comics Legal Defense Fund benefit graphic novel, More Fund Comics featuring Patrick's \"The Who'Whats!?\". At a signing at Howard University, the Time Dollar Institute's Dr. Edgar S. Cahn, approached Patrick after reading 'Blood of Onyx\" and that relationship grew into the comic, \"Time Dollars\". Patrick later worked with the Anime USA convention as both their Art Show & Artist Alley Director for 2002 & 2003 and with Capicons' Tysons Corner Comics Show as a featured guest and assisted Capicons in attaining guests. Through the relationship with Capicons, Patrick partnered and hosted his own pop culture comics convention, Americon bringing a San Diego Comicon experience to the east coast. Patrick and his company also appeared at Small Press Expo (SPX), Orlando Megacon and Wizardworld East in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 2006, Patrick jumped back into acting and the film industry after many contacts pursued him with film interests for his comics properties. Not wanting to let his characters freely go without a better idea of the industry, Patrick began working in multiple TV & film projects both in front of and behind the camera to gain experience and later joined both the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA). In 2007, Patrick set up Far East Films."}}, {"pk": 441, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:25:10", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Strova", "created": "2009-03-10 21:25:10", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "0835211", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Maria", "height": null, "slug": "maria-strova", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 319, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:12:17", "birthplace": "Burbank, California, USA", "surname": "Suarez", "created": "2009-03-10 21:12:17", "image": "", "birthdate": "6 July 1990", "imdb_id": "0836836", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Jeremy", "height": null, "slug": "jeremy-suarez", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 408, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:19:32", "birthplace": "Yamanashi, Japan", "surname": "Sugata", "created": "2009-03-10 21:19:32", "image": "", "birthdate": "17 February 1955", "imdb_id": "0837452", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Shun", "height": null, "slug": "shun-sugata", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 53, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 20:56:42", "birthplace": "Staten Island, New York City, New York, USA", "surname": "Sussman", "created": "2009-03-10 20:56:42", "image": "images/persons/kevin-sussman.jpg", "birthdate": "4 December 1970", "imdb_id": "0839934", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 91, "forename": "Kevin", "height": 140, "slug": "kevin-sussman", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 45, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 20:56:16", "birthplace": "London, England, UK", "surname": "Swinton", "created": "2009-03-10 20:56:16", "image": "images/persons/tilda-swinton.jpg", "birthdate": "5 November 1960", "imdb_id": "0842770", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "Tilda", "height": 119, "slug": "tilda-swinton", "biography": "The iconoclastic gifts of the visually striking and fiercely talented Scottish actress 'Tilda Swinton' (qv), who was born on November 5th, 1960, have been appreciated by a more international audience of late. Born into a patrician military family, she was educated at an English and a Scottish boarding school. Tilda subsequently studied Social and Politcal Science at Cambridge University and graduated in 1983 with a degree in English Literature. During her time as a student, she performed countless stage productions and proceeded to work for a season in the Royal Shakespeare Company. A decided rebel when it came to the arts, she left the company after a year as her approach shifted dramatically: With a taste for the unique and bizarre, she found some genuinely interesting gender-bending roles come her way, such as the composer Mozart in Pushkin's \"Mozart and Salieri\", and as a working class woman impersonating her dead husband during World War II, in Karges' _Man to Man (1992)_ (qv). In 1985 the pale-skinned, carrot-topped actress began a professional association with gay experimental director 'Derek Jarman' (qv). She continued to live and work with Jarman for the next nine years, developing seven critically acclaimed films. Their alliance would produce stark turns, such as turner-prize nominated _Caravaggio (1986)_ (qv), _The Last of England (1988)_ (qv), _The Garden (1990)_ (qv), _Edward II (1991)_ (qv), and _Wittgenstein (1993)_ (qv). Jarman succumbed to complications from AIDS in 1994. His untimely demise left a devastating void in Tilda's life for quite some time. Her most notable performance of that period however comes from a non-Jarman film: For the title role in _Orlando (1992)_ (qv), her nobleman character lives for 400 years while changing sex from man to woman. The film, which Swinton spent years helping writer/director 'Sally Potter' (qv) develop and finance, continues to this day to have a worldwide devoted fan following. Over the years she has preferred art to celebrity, opening herself to experimental projects with new and untried directors and mediums, delving into the worlds of installation art and cutting-edge fashion. Consistently off-centered roles in _Female Perversions (1996)_ (qv), _Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon (1998)_ (qv), _Teknolust (2002)_ (qv), _Young Adam (2003)_ (qv), _Broken Flowers (2005)_ (qv) and 'B\u00e9la Tarr' (qv)'s _A Londoni f\u00e9rfi (2007)_ (qv) have only added to her mystique. Hollywood too has picked up on this notoriety and, since the birth of her twins in 1997, she has successfully moved between the deep-left-field art-house and quality Hollywood blockbusters. The thriller _The Deep End (2001)_ (qv), earned her a number of critic's awards and her first Golden Globe nomination. Such mainstream U.S. pictures as _The Beach (2000/I)_ (qv) with 'Leonardo DiCaprio' (qv), fantasy epic _Constantine (2005)_ (qv) with 'Keanu Reeves' (qv), her Oscar-decorated performance in _Michael Clayton (2007)_ (qv) alongside 'George Clooney' (qv) and of course her iconic White Witch in _The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)_ (qv) have cemented her place as one of cinema's most outstanding women."}}, {"pk": 403, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:19:21", "birthplace": "", "surname": "Takahashi", "created": "2009-03-10 21:19:21", "image": "", "birthdate": "", "imdb_id": "1534063", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Issei", "height": null, "slug": "issei-takahashi", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 402, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:19:19", "birthplace": "Nagano, Japan", "surname": "Tanaka", "created": "2009-03-10 21:19:19", "image": "", "birthdate": "8 August 1963", "imdb_id": "0849093", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Yoji", "height": null, "slug": "yoji-tanaka", "biography": ""}}, {"pk": 336, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:24:39", "birthplace": "Knoxville, Tennessee, USA", "surname": "Tarantino", "created": "2009-03-10 21:15:39", "image": "images/persons/quentin-tarantino.jpg", "birthdate": "27 March 1963", "imdb_id": "0000233", "is_director": true, "visible": 1, "width": 100, "forename": "Quentin", "height": 140, "slug": "quentin-tarantino", "biography": "In January of 1992 a film titled _Reservoir Dogs (1992)_ (qv) hit the Sundance Film festival.

She moved to New York to follow her dream. A breakthrough role for the tall, blonde actress came when she played Cecile de Volanges in _Dangerous Liaisons (1988)_ (qv). More attention came with the NC-17 rated _Henry & June (1990)_ (qv), but it was Thurman's role in the 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) classic _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv) that earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

Radio programming, childhood books and weekend trips to the drive-in introduced her to the magical world of movies. It was not until the mid-'70s that South Africa finally got television, and the big black box in the family living room \"miraculously\" sprang to life. However, as the daughter of a ballet teacher, Musetta was no stranger to the entertainment world and debuted on stage at the age of four. Her childhood was filled with numerous dance performances including \"Giselle\", \"Coppelia\", \"The Student Prince\" and \"Showboat\", and, shortly after completing school, she qualified as a ballet teacher herself. After earning a BA in Communications and Psychology, she landed the plum job as anchor host for an MTV-like television show in South Africa. One day, a handsome visiting American, 'Jeff Celentano' (qv), spotted her on television, made her his bride, and whisked her off to the very place she had always dreamed of--Hollywood. Shortly after her arrival, she became part of the very world she used to host, appearing as the \"dream girl\" in more than 20 music videos for such top recording artists as 'Rod Stewart' (qv), 'Tina Turner' (qv), 'Elton John' (qv) and 'Chris Isaak' (qv). It was her critically acclaimed stage performance in the original South African play \"Soweto's Burning\", about the trials of an interracial friendship in that racially segregated country, that provided her transition to the big screen. Musetta has since performed in numerous feature films, including collaborating with her husband on _Under the Hula Moon (1995)_ (qv) and _Gunshy (1998)_ (qv). She has also worked alongside such screen veterans as 'Kevin Kline' (qv), 'Kenneth Branagh' (qv) and 'Will Smith' (qv) in _Wild Wild West (1999)_ (qv), 'George Clooney' (qv) and 'John Turturro' (qv) in _O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000)_ (qv) and 'John Hurt' (qv) and 'Louis Gossett Jr.' (qv) in _Monolith (1993)_ (qv). She's also added a slew of television credits to her arsenal, including guest appearances on the hit shows _\"Star Trek: Voyager\" (1995)_ (qv), _\"Stargate SG-1\" (1997)_ (qv) and _\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1997)_ (qv).

His mother Kitty Haywood, a legendary studio singer, was a staple in his young life and encouraged his pursuit of singing as well as acting. In being surrounded by the some of the best entertainers to date, Jason learned some of the most intricate works of the industry and found himself even more intrigued and driven in his goal of stardom. Weaver got his break in acting as a kid named Ernie, in the movie, \"The Kid Who Loved Christmas\". By the age of 12, Jason had appeared in two other projects; \"The Long Walk Home\", a film by Whoopi Goldberg and \"Brewster's Place\", a television series produced by Oprah Winfrey. Having been successful in his previous three roles, it was imminent that this young man's career would be of legendary status. In 1992, Weaver landed the role of a lifetime. He was cast to play the young and most talented Michael Jackson in the small screen film, \"The Jackson's: An American Dream.\" This made for television movie garnered him raved reviews and proved to be a launching pad for other areas of his career. 1993 branded Weaver in one of the two most notable roles of his career. Playing alongside Brandy in the television series \"Thea\", Jason continued his acting success until the abrupt cancellation of the show later that year. Weaver landed a role in one of the top Disney film's in 1994. Jason was blessed with the opportunity to display his other talent; singing. He graced us with his passionate sound as the singing voice of Simba in the box office hit, \"The Lion King\". In 1997, he continued his on screen success as teenage sibling, Marcus Henderson, in the hit television series \"Smart Guy\". After a two year hiatus, Jason was back at it with a role in the civil rights movie, \"Freedom Song\", starring Danny Glover and Loretta Divine, to name a few. The turn of the millennium also brought about a huge turn in Weaver's career. In 2002, he enjoyed a highly successful role as Earnest in the mega hit movie \"Drumline\", opposite Nick Cannon. The movie was set in Jason's hometown of Atlanta. In 2004, Weaver followed the success of \"Drumline\" with a role in \"The Lady Killers\", starring Tom Hank. In 2006, 'Jason Weaver' (qv) was back in Atlanta to shoot \"ATL\", starring T.I. The Chris Robinson film was set in a roller rink and depicted the life of a teenage male that deals with the everyday struggles of finance, school, and friendship, but finds solace in a female that he meets at the roller rink he frequents. Let it be known that TI's female costar is not as she appears. The movie was a huge box office success. In addition to Jason's enormous success as an actor, he sets his site on his other love, music. After releasing only one of his two albums with Motown in the early 90s, Weaver enjoyed short lived success from \"Love Ambition\". He has since refocused his energy and dedication to long hours in the studio in pursuit of his musical dreams. The 2004 hit, \"One Call Away\" by Chingy, featured a rejuvenated Weaver singing the hook. This single topped the Billboard 100 chart at #2 in the U.S and #26 in the UK. In late 2006, Jason worked with BG on his new album and did several collaborations with close friend and super producer/writer Roger \"Mista Raja\" Green on his album, \"Chip off the Ol' Block\", due to be released in mid 2007. With Weaver's long list of accomplishments in his star career, many power hitters in the entertainment industry suggest that this Hollywood story is only at its midpoint. Jason is set to release his second album, entitled, \"Declaration of Independance\", in early summer 2007."}}, {"pk": 192, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:04:57", "birthplace": "Ft.

More recently, indie director 'Robert Rodriguez' (qv) cast him alongside FX guru 'Tom Savini' (qv) as two vampire killing bikers, in his bloody action film _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv), and he has most recently appeared on screen (displaying his wonderful comedy skills) playing grumpy Captain Dobey in _Starsky & Hutch (2004)_ (qv)."}}, {"pk": 251, "model": "movie.person", "fields": {"edited": "2009-03-10 21:08:23", "birthplace": "Mineola, Texas, USA", "surname": "Willingham", "created": "2009-03-10 21:08:23", "image": "", "birthdate": "31 August 1931", "imdb_id": "0932244", "is_director": false, "visible": 1, "width": null, "forename": "Noble", "height": null, "slug": "noble-willingham", "biography": "'Noble Willingham' (qv) has appeared in more than 30 feature films, including _Up Close & Personal (1996)_ (qv), _Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994)_ (qv), _Chinatown (1974)_ (qv), Good Morning, Vietnam, City Slickers, City Slickers II, and The Distinguished Gentleman.
