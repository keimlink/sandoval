Her mother, 'Beverly Marston-Braun' (qv), was known as \"Miss Beverly\", the host of _\"Romper Room\" (1953)_ (qv), a popular children's TV show, and her father was a Navy pilot. Wendy began acting at age 12, as the Scarecrow in \"The Wiz\", and continued performing in musicals and plays at Glenbrook South High School, as well as at Indiana University, where she graduated early to pursue acting. A trained professional dancer, Wendy spent a summer performing in Monte Carlo with such artists as 'Stevie Wonder' (qv), 'Barry White' (qv) and 'Natalie Cole' (qv). There she won over one of her biggest fans, 'Prince Albert of Monaco' (qv), who later escorted her to her film premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. Wendy soon starred in several award-winning film festival hits. 'Ivan Reitman' (qv) spotted her in two films at Sundance and cast her in DreamWorks' _Evolution (2001)_ (qv) alongside 'David Duchovny' (qv) and 'Julianne Moore' (qv). Her comedic timing and improvisation skills prompted ad executives to create a 26-spot Mervyn's campaign for her. A standout in these spots, Wendy quickly won more roles in film and television. She has been recently seen guest-starring on _\"Lost\" (2004)_ (qv), _\"All of Us\" (2003)_ (qv), _\"Navy NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service\" (2003)_ (qv), and acting alongside 'Martin Lawrence' (qv) in _Big Momma's House 2 (2006)_ (qv). Wendy is now recurring as \"Ms. Sneed\" on _\"General Hospital\" (1963)_ (qv) and plays 'Vincent Spano' (qv)'s FBI partner in the mini-series _Pandemic (2007) (TV)_ (qv). Wendy is also a fitness enthusiast and triathlete. She recently completed the Malibu Triathlon, where she won medals two years in a row in the Female Celebrity Division, and helped to raise money for the 'Elizabeth Glaser' (qv) Pediatric Aids Foundation."

         "biography":"The son of well-known film and TV star 'Lloyd Bridges' (qv) and his long-time wife 'Dorothy Dean Bridges' (qv), Jeff was born on December 4, 1949 in Los Angeles, California, and grew up amid the happening Hollywood scene with big brother 'Beau Bridges' (qv). Both boys popped up unbilled alongside their mother in the film _The Company She Keeps (1951)_ (qv), and appeared on occasion with their famous dad on his popular underwater TV series _\"Sea Hunt\" (1958)_ (qv) while growing up. At age 14, Jeff toured with his father in a stage production of \"Anniversary Waltz\". The \"troublesome teen\" years proved just that for Jeff and his parents were compelled at one point to intervene when problems with drugs and marijuana got out of hand. He recovered and began shaping his nascent young adult career appearing on TV as a younger version of his father in the acclaimed TV-movie _Silent Night, Lonely Night (1969) (TV)_ (qv), and in the strange 'Burgess Meredith' (qv) film _The Yin and the Yang of Mr. Go (1970)_ (qv). Following fine notices for his portrayal of a white student caught up in the racially-themed _Halls of Anger (1970)_ (qv), his career-maker arrived just a year later when he earned a coming-of-age role in the critically-acclaimed ensemble film _The Last Picture Show (1971)_ (qv). The 'Peter Bogdanovich' (qv)- helmed film made stars out off its young leads (Bridges, 'Timothy Bottoms' (qv), 'Cybill Shepherd' (qv)) and Oscar winners out of its older cast ('Ben Johnson' (qv), 'Cloris Leachman' (qv)). The role, for which Jeff received an Oscar-nomination (for \"best supporting actor\") set the tone for the types of roles Jeff would acquaint himself with his fans -- rambling, reckless, rascally and usually unpredictable). Owning a casual carefree handsomeness and armed with a perpetual grin and sly charm, he started immediately on an intriguing 70s sojourn into offbeat filming. Chief among them were his boxer on his way up opposite a declining 'Stacy Keach' (qv) in _Fat City (1972)_ (qv); his Civil War-era conman in the western _Bad Company (1972)_ (qv); his redneck stock car racer in _The Last American Hero (1973)_ (qv); his young student anarchist opposite a stellar veteran cast in Eugene O'Neill's _The Iceman Cometh (1973)_ (qv); his bank-robbing (also Oscar-nominated) sidekick to 'Clint Eastwood' (qv) in _Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974)_ (qv); his aimless cattle rustler in _Rancho Deluxe (1975)_ (qv); his low-level western writer who wants to be a real-life cowboy in _Hearts of the West (1975)_ (qv); and his brother of an assassinated President who pursues leads to the crime in _Winter Kills (1979)_ (qv). All are simply marvelous characters that should have propelled him to the very top rungs of stardom...but strangely didn't. Perhaps it was his trademark ease and naturalistic approach that made him somewhat under appreciated at that time when Hollywood was run by a 'Dustin Hoffman' (qv), 'Robert De Niro' (qv) and 'Al Pacino' (qv)-like intensity. Neverthless, Jeff continued to be a scene-stealing favorite into the next decade, notably as the video game programmer in the 1982 sci-fi cult classic _TRON (1982)_ (qv), and the struggling musician brother vying with brother 'Beau Bridges' (qv) over the attentions of sexy singer 'Michelle Pfeiffer' (qv) in _The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989)_ (qv). Jeff became a third-time Oscar nominee with his highly intriguing (and strangely sexy) portrayal of a blank-faced alien in _\"Starman\" (1986)_ (qv), and earned high regard as the ever-optimistic inventor Preston Tucker in _Tucker: The Man and His Dream (1988)_ (qv). Since then Jeff has continued to pour on the Bridges magic on film. Few enjoy such an enduring popularity while maintaining equal respect with the critics. _The Fisher King (1991)_ (qv), _American Heart (1992)_ (qv), _Fearless (1993)_ (qv), _The Big Lebowski (1998)_ (qv) and _The Contender (2000)_ (qv) (a fourth Oscar nomination) are prime examples. More recently he seized the moment as a bald-pated villain as 'Robert Downey Jr.' (qv)'s nemesis in _Iron Man (2008)_ (qv). Jeff has been married since 1977 to non-professional Susan Geston (they met on the set of _Rancho Deluxe (1975)_ (qv)). The couple have three daughters, Isabelle (born 1981), Jessica (born 1983), and Hayley (born 1985). He hobbies as a photographer on and off his film sets, and has been known to play around as a cartoonist and pop musician."

         "biography":"\"Uncle Sam's favorite son\" as the lyrics to the theme of _\"Jack of All Trades\" (2000)_ (qv) go, was born June 22, 1958 (the youngest of 3 brothers) in Royal Oak, Michigan. As a child, Bruce watched _\"Lost in Space\" (1965)_ (qv) on TV, and ran around dressed as Zorro. He got the acting bug at age 8; his dad was performing in local community theater. At 14, Bruce got to play the young prince in \"The King and I\" and even got to sing. He went on to appear in several community theater productions, including \"South Pacific\". However, he was also interested in directing, and shot super-8 flicks with a neighborhood pal. Perhaps through fate, he met future director 'Sam Raimi' (qv) in a high school drama class in 1975. Soon, along with Sam, and now a bunch of other high school pals, Bruce filmed about 50 super-8 movies. During the summer of 1976, he was an apprentice in northern Michigan at Traverse City's Cherry County Playhouse, a summer-stock company. Bruce worked 18-hour days putting up sets, being assistant stage manager, doing errands, etc. No money, but it was a learning experience (it was show biz). He attended Western Michigan University and took theater courses. Bruce became a production assistant for a company that made commercials in Detroit. In the early part of 1979, with buddy 'Sam Raimi' (qv), he decided to become a pro filmmaker. Armed with a super-8 horror film _Within the Woods (1978)_ (qv) which they showed potential investors, they raised $350,000 to make _The Evil Dead (1981)_ (qv) which Bruce co-produced and starred in as \"Ash\". Four years later, the completed film became the best-selling video of 1983 in England, and New Line Cinema got it a US release. Around this time, he married his first wife, and they had 2 kids. They raised 10 times as much cash for the sequel _Evil Dead II (1987)_ (qv) again co-produced by Bruce and starring him as \"Ash\". He moved to L.A. In 1990, while filming _Mindwarp (1992)_ (qv), he met his future second wife (costume designer 'Ida Gearon' (qv)) on the set. In 1992, he rejoined Sam, and Bruce co-produced and starred as \"Ash\" in the 3rd of the Evil Dead trilogy, _Army of Darkness (1992)_ (qv) for Universal Studios. On TV, Bruce directed many episodes of _\"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\" (1995)_ (qv). Bruce also acted as the recurring character \"Autolycus\", the King of Thieves; he portrayed this villain with zest in both _\"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\" (1995)_ (qv) and _\"Xena: Warrior Princess\" (1995)_ (qv). Bruce's latest television venture was starring as the title rogue of _\"Jack of All Trades\" (2000)_ (qv). Everybody loves Jack. And everybody's heard of him -- \"There ain't a French or pirate rogue who don't know Jack!\"."

Her fans not only admire her mouth-watering body but also her brains - Asia is known to be a very intelligent person. At the tender age of 13 the daughter of a German father and a Japanese mother already played J. S. Bach on the piano in Carnegie Hall. Thanks to a federal grant she was able to study Japanese language and Economics at Rutgers University in the USA. But this was only after she had run away from home as a teenager because of the pressure her demanding parents put on her. By the age of 17 she was homeless. To get through her studies at the university she turned to stripping. After becoming one of New Jersey's best-paid exotic dancers she decided to devote her life to getting richer and richer. She never wanted to live out on the street again. When she heard about girls making thousands of dollars in the porn biz she moved to Los Angeles. A mutual friend introduced her to director 'Bud Lee' (qv) who instantly put her in one of his feature films. The rest - as they say - is history... Today Asia has retired from making adult movies and only ever returns to do the occasional big-budget flick. She runs her own homepage and spends her time chatting with fans via email or day trading shares at the stock exchange."

         "biography":"Michael Peter Balzary was born on the 16th of October 1962, in Melbourne, Australia. When he was four, his parents divorced and Michael, his sister Karen and his mother Patricia headed for New York, but they didn't stay long and soon ended up in L.A. (in 1972), where his step-father, a jazz musician named Walter Urban Jr, intended to start a career. 'Flea' (qv) would often sit in on weekly jam sessions with his stepdad and the constant flow of musicians who trucked through. High school was not always an easy road for young Michael. He was kind of a misfit because of his unusual musical taste. While most of the kids were into disco and dance music, 'Flea' (qv) preferred jazz artists like 'Miles Davis' (qv) and 'Dizzy Gillespie' (qv). 'Flea' (qv)'s first musical instrument were the drums, but soon he choosed the trumpet; after school he would race home to listen to his Gillespie records and play along with his idol. He counts as his greatest childhood memory the time his mother got him backstage to meet Gillespie after one of his concerts. He also played with the Los Angeles Junior Philarmonic Orchestra. Influenced by some of his friends from school who shared the same passion for music - among them, 'Jack Irons' (qv) and 'Hillel Slovak' (qv), who would later play in the 'Red Hot Chili Peppers' (qv) with him - his musical interests then diversified, he discovered funk music, and 'Jimi Hendrix' (qv) became his new idol. At the end of 1977, he met 'Anthony Kiedis' (qv). For some reason, Michael was holding a young schoolmate named Tony Sherr in a headlock, when Kiedis, who was Tony's best friend at the time, came to rescue him, and the both almost had a fight, but soon became aware they were made to be friends, and have been inseparable since. The two became known for their mischievous antics, which often got them into trouble. That's also at this time that he gained his nickname 'Flea' (qv), while he was joking with some friends about calling each other with a cartoon name. Around 1979, due to 'Flea' (qv)'s obvious musical talent, he was sought out as a recruit for a band formed by his schoolmates, Anthym, with 'Jack Irons' (qv) (drums), 'Hillel Slovak' (qv) (guitar) and 'Alain Johannes' (qv) (vocals and guitar) as members. 'Flea' (qv) picked up the bass, which he had never played before, and became so good that within a few months he had forged his very own style, which later would make him one of the most famous and talented bass players in the world. After a shaky start the band got a few club gigs but no major breaks. 'Anthony Kiedis' (qv) was always there to support them, and became the presenter of their shows, that he opened with a few jokes or improvised poems of his own. During the year 1982, 'Flea' (qv) joined the L.A. punk band Fear. He also landed a small role in the 'Penelope Spheeris' (qv) film Suburbia (1984) . John Lydon of PIL asked 'Flea' (qv) to join his band when he left Fear in 1984, but 'Flea' (qv) decided to rejoin his friends instead. With Kiedis, Slovak and Irons, they had started another band together, the 'Red Hot Chili Peppers' (qv), which soon earned a good reputation in the Los Angeles underground music scene. 'Flea' (qv) was married in 1985 to Loesha Zeviar, whose first name he got tattooed above his left nipple - close to his heart. They have since divorced, but still share daughter Clara, born on September 16, 1988. Clara sometimes goes on theroad with her dad, and has done artwork for the Chili Peppers' t-shirts and promotional material. In 2001, along with friends Pete Weiss and Keith Barry, 'Flea' (qv) founded the Silverlake Conservatory Of Music, a organization whose aim is to provide affordable music lessons to everyone and to encourage children's musical education."

         "biography":"'Ben Gazzara' (qv)'s screen career began with two critically acclaimed roles as heavies in the late fifties. He turned to television in the sixties but made a big screen comeback with roles in three 'John Cassavetes' (qv) films in the seventies. The 1980s and 1990s saw Gazzara work more frequently than ever before in character parts. If he never became the leading man his early films and stage work promised he has had a career notable for its longevity. He was born Biagio Anthony Gazzara in New York City in 1930. The son of a Sicilian immigrant laborer, he grew up on New York's tough Lower East Side. After seeing 'Laurette Taylor' (qv) in \"The Glass Menagerie\", Gazzara decided he wanted to become an actor. He studied engineering (unhappily) but quit after receiving an acting scholarship (he worked under well-known coach 'Erwin Piscator' (qv)). He then joined the Actors' Studio where a group of students improvised a play from 'Calder Willingham' (qv)'s novel End as a Man. The tale of a brutal Southern Military academy reached Broadway slightly changed in 1953 but with Gazzara still in the principal role. It was a star making part (he won a Theatre World award) and he then played leads in the original productions of \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" (1955) and \"A Hatful of Rain\" (1955) (he was nominated for a Tony). Bigger names 'Paul Newman' (qv) and 'Don Murray' (qv) played those last two roles on the big screen but Gazzara made his movie debut in _The Strange One (1957)_ (qv) the film version of \"End as a Man\". The film was a critical but not commercial success. His next role was as the defendant in _Anatomy of a Murder (1959)_ (qv) which was a big hit. He followed this with an Italian venture co-starring 'Anna Magnani' (qv), _Risate di gioia (1960)_ (qv), two Hollywood films _The Young Doctors (1961)_ (qv) and _Convicts 4 (1962)_ (qv) and then another Italian film _Citt\u00e0 prigioniera, La (1962)_ (qv). None of these did much for his career and he turned to television. He appeared in the successful shows _\"Arrest and Trial\" (1963)_ (qv) and _\"Run for Your Life\" (1965)_ (qv). In between, he made _A Rage to Live (1965)_ (qv), a film version of 'John O'Hara' (qv)'s novel. He returned to films in _The Bridge at Remagen (1969)_ (qv) and with a cameo appearance in _If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium (1969)_ (qv). His buddy in the cameo was 'John Cassavetes' (qv) who directed and co-starred with him in _Husbands (1970)_ (qv), a critical success. Gazzara made two more well-received films with his good friend Cassavetes: _The Killing of a Chinese Bookie (1976)_ (qv) and _Opening Night (1977)_ (qv). Gazzara's other films in the 1970s were undistinguished apart from the sprawling _Voyage of the Damned (1976)_ (qv) and a rare leading role in director 'Peter Bogdanovich' (qv)'s _Saint Jack (1979)_ (qv). _Bloodline (1979)_ (qv) and _They All Laughed (1981)_ (qv) (also directed by Bogdanovich) were only notable because of Gazzara's off-screen relationship with co-star 'Audrey Hepburn' (qv) (ironically, Gazzara had declined to make his screen debut in _War and Peace (1956)_ (qv) starring Hepburn). _Storie di ordinaria follia (1981)_ (qv) was another lead for Gazzara but it received a mixed critical reception. Other big screen roles in the eighties were scarce apart from _Road House (1989)_ (qv), a 'Patrick Swayze' (qv) vehicle which Gazzara believed out of all his films has been the most repeated on television. He worked much on the small screen, including the ground-breaking television movie _An Early Frost (1985) (TV)_ (qv), playing the father of an AIDS victim. The 1990s saw Gazzarra working like never before, appearing in 38 films! Most were for free-to-air television or cable but he also worked on the big screen in _The Spanish Prisoner (1997)_ (qv), _The Big Lebowski (1998)_ (qv), _Happiness (1998)_ (qv) and _Summer of Sam (1999)_ (qv). His TV work included a guest appearance as an executive assistant attorney in a 2001 episode of _\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" (1999)_ (qv) - a nice touch since _\"Arrest and Trial\" (1963)_ (qv) was the predecessor of _\"Law & Order\" (1990)_ (qv) and its spin-off shows. Gazzara has often returned to the stage throughout his career - in \"The Night Circus\" (1958) (where he met second wife 'Janice Rule' (qv)), \"Strange Interlude\" (1963), \"Traveller Without Luggage\" (1964), Hughie/Duet (1975) (nominated for a Tony), \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (1976) (again Tony nominated) and \"Shimada\" (1992). He has also worked as a director on episodes his series _\"Run for Your Life\" (1965)_ (qv) and _\"The Name of the Game\" (1968)_ (qv) and the television movies _Columbo: A Friend in Deed (1974) (TV)_ (qv) and _Columbo: Troubled Waters (1975) (TV)_ (qv) featuring his friend 'Peter Falk' (qv). The unreleased _Oltre l'oceano (1990)_ (qv) (which he also wrote) is his final film as a director to date. Now in his seventies, Gazzara is still acting. In 2003 he appeared in the independent _Dogville (2003)_ (qv) adding 'Lars von Trier' (qv) to the list of interesting and acclaimed directors with whom he has worked. There can't be many actors who can boast that they have acted in films by 'Otto Preminger' (qv) (_Anatomy of a Murder (1959)_ (qv)), 'John Cassavetes' (qv), 'Joel Coen' (qv) (_Big Lebowksi, The (1998)_ ), 'Spike Lee' (qv) (_Summer of Sam (1999)_ (qv)) and 'Lars von Trier' (qv) among others!"

         "biography":"Country-folk singer/songwriter 'Jimmie Dale Gilmore' (qv) is best known for his unusual fusion of traditional honky-tonk, Hank Williams-ish country stylings with lyrics influenced by Eastern mysticism and philosophy. Born and raised among country musicians in West Texas, Gilmore grew up in Lubbock, a small, dying cattle ranch community that, by chance, has produced some of Texas' most critically acclaimed musicians, including the great Buddy Holly, folk songstress Nanci Griffith, country superstar Waylon Jennings, and Gilmore's friends and collaborators, Joe Ely and Butch Hancock. Part Cherokee, Gilmore's look and style have always been somewhat unusual for the honky-tonk milieu. Gilmore briefly attempted a music career after high school, forming the now-legendary Flatlanders with Hancock and Ely, but by 1974 his growing interest in spirituality led him to leave Texas behind - and music along with it - to join a Taoist community in Denver, Colorado. In the '80s, having developed an aesthetic that merged his love of country with his spiritual interests, Gilmore moved to Austin, Texas to re-initiate his music career, and within a few months was playing regularly around town. He released two independent label records in the late '80s before Elektra released his breakthrough album \"Spinning Around the Sun\" in 1993. The album made numerous end-of-the-year 'best of' lists in the media, and Gilmore's career was given an extra boost by high profile fans such as David Letterman and Natalie Merchant. Gilmore's reputation was further enhanced by the reissue of an out-of-print Flatlanders record made in Nashville in 1972, released by Rounder records in 1991 under the title 'More a Legend Than a Band.' He has continued to release solo records, and in 2002, reunited with high school buddies Butch Hancock and Joe Ely (the Bruce Springsteen of Texas), to reform the Flatlanders. Gilmore's first film appearance was a brief cameo in 1993's 'The Thing Called Love,' an account of young singer/songwriters trying to break into the Nashville music scene, directed by Peter Bogdanovich and starring then-unknown Sandra Bullock and River Phoenix in one of his final roles. In 1996, Gilmore was recruited by his producer, T-Bone Burnett, to appear in the new Coen Brothers film, 'The Big Lebowski,' on which Burnett was also working as musical director (One of the world's foremost authorities on traditional American music, Burnett has collaborated on several Coen films, and was largely responsible for the massively successful 'O Brother, Where Art Thou' soundtrack). Gilmore appears as Smokey, the 'pacifist' bowler whom John Goodman's Walter threatens to shoot for allegedly stepping 'over the line' when throwing a strike. The inside joke, of course, is that, as a practicing Taoist, Gilmore is himself a pacifist. Gilmore was also recruited by fan and friend Billy Bob Thornton to contribute to the soundtrack and appear briefly in \"Monster's Ball\" singing in a honky-tonk; he has also contributed original music for the soundtrack of Robert Redford's \"The Horse Whisperer.\""

After becoming involved in high school theatrics, he attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, graduating with a B.F.A. degree in Drama in 1989.

While he had supporting roles in some other major productions, his breakthrough role came in 'Paul Thomas Anderson' (qv)'s _Boogie Nights (1997)_ (qv). He quickly became an icon of indie cinema, establishing a reputation as one of the screen's finest actors, in a variety of supporting and second leads in indie and major features, including 'Todd Solondz' (qv)'s _Happiness (1998)_ (qv), _Flawless (1999)_ (qv), _The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)_ (qv), 'Paul Thomas Anderson' (qv)'s _Magnolia (1999)_ (qv), _Almost Famous (2000)_ (qv) and _State and Main (2000)_ (qv). He also appeared in supporting roles in such mainstream, big-budget features as _Red Dragon (2002)_ (qv), _Cold Mountain (2003)_ (qv) and the upcoming _Mission: Impossible III (2006)_ (qv). Hoffman is also quite active on the stage. On Broadway, he has earned two Tony nominations, as Best Actor (Play) in 2000 for a revival of 'Sam Shepard' (qv)'s \"True West\" and as Best Actor (Featured Role - Play) in 2003 for a revival of 'Eugene O'Neill' (qv) (I)'s \"Long Day's Journey into Night\". His other acting credits in the New York theater include \"The Seagull\" (directed by 'Mike Nichols' (qv) for The New York Shakespeare Festival), \"Defying Gravity\", \"The Merchant of Venice\" (directed by 'Peter Sellars' (qv)), \"Shopping and F*@%ing\" and \"The Author's Voice\" (Drama Desk nomination).

He also has directed \"In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings\" and \"Jesus Hopped the A Train\" by Guirgis for LAByrinth, and \"The Glory of Living\" by 'Rebecca Gilman' (qv) at the Manhattan Class Company. Hoffman consolidated his reputation as one of the finest actors under the age of 40 with his turn in the title role of _Capote (2005)_ (qv), for which he won the Los Angeles Film Critics Award as Best Actor. In 2006, he was awarded the Best Actor Oscar for the same role."

Some of his earliest memories include collecting eggs from the chicken coupe, returning with upwards of 19 or 20 peck marks on his face alone. James lettered in soccer and wrestling at Chevrous High School, where he came under the personal tutilege of Rev. Francis \"Mad Dog\" McManus SJ. Father Frank, as he so affectionately referred to him, taught him the true meaning of wrestling. Later in life, Hoosier grew to be an avid bowler, which made him the obvious choice to play Liam, the silent but deadly, fat guy dancing associate of Jesus \"The Jesus\" Quintano. When the Cohen brothers came calling at his adopted home in Winthrop, Massachusetts' prestigious Governors Park, He couldn't refuse. Today, Jim Hoosier entertains captive audiences with his own one man show, entitled, \"No Father, Don't\", which runs every winter at the Cape Cod Playhouse in Hyannis."

It was there John found a passion for acting and became a Denver Broncos fan. He graduated in the mid-80s with a B.F.A. in theatre from the The Catholic University of America / Hartke Theatre Acting program. From then, he continued to work in theatre around the country, but concentrated mostly on his work at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, acting in many plays from Shakespeare to Shaw to Chekhov. In the early nineties, John was able to find time away from the theatre to work in film, as productions came through Minnesota. In 1996, he received critical acclaim for his role as Marge Gunderson's simple husband Norm Gunderson in _Fargo (1996)_ (qv). He went on to make two more films that year, both of which were conveniently set in Minnesota, the acclaimed _Beautiful Girls (1996)_ (qv) and _Feeling Minnesota (1996)_ (qv). Since then, John's film career has been on an amazing climb. Much like other well respected actors from the theatre, such as 'John Malkovich' (qv) and 'Gary Sinise' (qv), he chooses to play very interesting and diverse roles."

         "biography":"At 6' 2\" and 190 pounds, 'Michael Madsen' (qv) - the brother of actress 'Virginia Madsen' (qv) - is equally adept at portraying heroic as well as villainous characters. There's just something in the way he delivers his lines with an underlying aggression masked behind his gravelly tones that makes you feel very uneasy about his true intentions! Madsen first learned his craft at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre, where he worked under 'John Malkovich' (qv), one of the theater's founders. His first few film roles were minor ones, in such projects as _Against All Hope (1982)_ (qv), _Racing with the Moon (1984)_ (qv) and _The Natural (1984)_ (qv). His work received considerable notice, however, after his knife-edged performance as deranged killer Vince Miller in _Kill Me Again (1989)_ (qv) and then as 'Susan Sarandon' (qv)'s rough-edged boyfriend Jimmy in _Thelma & Louise (1991)_ (qv). His big breakthrough, however, came as the sadistic jewel thief Mr. Blonde in 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv)'s low-budget hit _Reservoir Dogs (1992)_ (qv). Movie audiences were glued to their seats as Madsen playfully danced around a tied-down and terrified police officer, slicing him with a knife and splashing gasoline all over the petrified man, all to the cheery tunes of \"Stealer's Wheels' \"Stuck In the Middle With You.\" Not to be typecast, Madsen surprised many with his performance as foster parent Glen Greenwood in the hit family movie _Free Willy (1993)_ (qv) before returning to another criminal role as bank robber Rudy Travis in the remake of the 'Steve McQueen' (qv) heist flick _The Getaway (1994)_ (qv), and then back again as Glen Greenwood in _Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (1995)_ (qv). Madsen continues to turn in edge-of-the-seat performances as morally bankrupt individuals on the wrong side of the law, as in his intense on-screen showings in _Donnie Brasco (1997)_ (qv), _Mulholland Falls (1996)_ (qv), and _High Noon (2000) (TV)_ (qv). In 2003 he teamed up again with Tarantino in both \"volumes\" of Tarantino's magnum martial arts/revenge opus _Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)_ (qv) and _Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)_ (qv) as the coldly evil Budd (aka \"Sidewinder\"). In addition to his film work, Madsen has contributed dialogue to two of Sony PlayStations's biggest-selling games, _Grand Theft Auto III (2001) (VG)_ (qv) and _Driv3r (2004) (VG)_ (qv), as well as writing several books of his own poetry. Although uncomfortable with fame, Madsen's star continues to shine in Hollywood and his droll, yet captivating acting style is ensuring him a steady flow of work as one on the screen's favorite \"heavies\"."

She earned her B.A. in Theater from Bethany College in 1979 and her MFA from Yale in 1982. Her career after graduation began onstage, and she has retained her association with the theater throughout her career. She soon obtained prominent roles in movies as well, first starring in _Blood Simple. (1984)_ (qv), in which she worked with filmmaker 'Joel Coen' (qv), whom she married that year. She frequently collaborated with Coen and his brother 'Ethan Coen' (qv) in their films. McDormand's skilled and versatile acting has been recognized by both the critics and the Academy and, in addition to many critics' awards, she has been nominated for an Academy award four times - for _Mississippi Burning (1988)_ (qv), _Fargo (1996)_ (qv) (for which she won the Best Actress award), _Almost Famous (2000)_ (qv) and _North Country (2005)_ (qv). Keenly intelligent and possessed of a sharp wit, McDormand is the antithesis of the Hollywood starlet - rather than making every role about 'Frances McDormand' (qv), 'Frances McDormand' (qv) dissolves into the characters she plays. Accordingly, she has expressed some reservations about the iconic recognition she has gained from her touching and amusing portrayal of Police Chief Marge Gunderson, the quintessential Minnesota Scandinavian, in _Fargo (1996)_ (qv). McDormand and Coen adopted a son, Pedro, who was born in Paraguay, in 1994. They live in Manhattan."

He settled in Los Angeles in the mid 1950s where he was noticed by Roger Corman who cast him in most of his low budget horror films where he usually played unlikeable sorts beginning as a vacuum cleaning salesman in Not of This Earth. But his most memorable role is in a rare starring role in playing the mentally unstable, busboy/beatnik artist Walter Paisley, whose clay sculptures are suspiciously lifelike in A Bucket of Blood. But he is best remembered for a supporting role as the flower-eating Vurson Fouch in Corman's The Little Shop of Horrors. He then spent the next 20 years working in Roger Corman productions, and starting in the late 1970s 'Joe Dante' (qv) flicks, appearing in credited and uncredited walk-on bits playing quirky chatterboxes which he stole every scene he appeared in. His role of Walter Paisley has been repeated many times such as a diner owner (Twilight Zone-The Movie) or a janitor (Chopping Mall). One of his best bits is the funny occult bookshop owner in The Howling. Being short (so he never played a romantic lead or a threatening villain), with wavy hair, long sideburns, a pointed nose, and a face as trustful as a used-car dealer's, he was, and still is to this day, an immediately recognizable character actor whose one-scene appearances in countless movies and TV shows guarantee audience applause."

She spent the early years of her life in over two dozen locations around the world with her parents before she finally found her place at Boston University, where she earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree in acting from the School of the Performing Arts. After graduation (in 1983), Julianne moved to New York and worked extensively in theater, including appearances off-Broadway in two Caryl Churchill plays, Serious Money and Ice Cream With Hot Fudge and as Ophelia in Hamlet at The Guthrie Theatre. But despite her formal training, Julianne fell into the attractive actress' trap of the mid-1980's: TV soaps and miniseries. She appeared briefly in the daytime serial _\"The Edge of Night\" (1956)_ (qv) and from 1985 to 1988 she played two half-sisters Frannie and Sabrina on the soap _\"As the World Turns\" (1956)_ (qv). This performance later led to an Outstanding Ing\u00e9nue Daytime Emmy Award in 1988. Her subsequent appearances were in mostly forgettable TV-movies, such as _Money, Power, Murder. (1989) (TV)_ (qv), _The Last to Go (1991) (TV)_ (qv) and _Cast a Deadly Spell (1991) (TV)_ (qv). She made her entrance into the big screen with 1990's _Tales from the Darkside: The Movie (1990)_ (qv), where she played the victim of a mummy. Two years later, Julianne appeared in feature films with supporting parts in _The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (1992)_ (qv) and the comedy _The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag (1992)_ (qv). She kept winning better and more powerful roles as time went on, including a small but memorable role as 'Harrison Ford' (qv)'s colleague in _The Fugitive (1993)_ (qv). (A role that made such an impression on 'Steven Spielberg' (qv) that he cast her in the _Jurassic Park (1993)_ (qv) sequel without an audition in 1997). In one of Moore's most distinguished performances, she recapitulated her \"beguiling Yelena\" from 'Andre Gregory' (qv)'s workshop version of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya in 'Louis Malle' (qv)'s critically acclaimed _Vanya on 42nd Street (1994)_ (qv). Director 'Todd Haynes' (qv) gave Julianne her first opportunity to take on a lead role in _Safe (1995)_ (qv). Her portrayal of Carol White, an affluent L.A. housewife who develops an inexplicable allergic reaction to her environment, won critical praise as well as an Independent Spirit Award nomination. Later that year she found her way into romantic comedy, co-starring as 'Hugh Grant' (qv)'s pregnant girlfriend in _Nine Months (1995)_ (qv). Following films included _Assassins (1995)_ (qv), where she played an electronics security expert targeted for death (next to 'Sylvester Stallone' (qv) and 'Antonio Banderas' (qv)) and _Surviving Picasso (1996)_ (qv), where she played Dora Maar, one of the numerous lovers of Picasso (portrayed by her hero, 'Anthony Hopkins' (qv)). A year later, after co-starring in Spielberg's _The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)_ (qv), opposite 'Jeff Goldblum' (qv), a young and unknown director, 'Paul Thomas Anderson' (qv) asked Julianne to appear in his movie, _Boogie Nights (1997)_ (qv). Despite her misgivings, she finally was won over by the script and her decision to play the role of Amber Waves, a loving porn star who acts as a mother figure to a ragtag crew, proved to be a wise one, since she received both Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. Julianne started 1998 by playing an erotic artist in _The Big Lebowski (1998)_ (qv), continued with a small role in the social comedy _Chicago Cab (1997)_ (qv) and ended with a subtle performance in 'Gus Van Sant' (qv)'s remake of _Psycho (1960)_ (qv). 1999 had Moore as busy as an actress can be. She starred in a number of high-profile projects, beginning with 'Robert Altman' (qv)'s _Cookie's Fortune (1999)_ (qv) , in which she was cast as the mentally challenged but adorable sister of a decidedly unhinged 'Glenn Close' (qv). A portrayal of the scheming Mrs. Cheveley followed in 'Oliver Parker' (qv)'s _An Ideal Husband (1999)_ (qv) with a number of critics asserting that Moore was the best part of the movie. She then enjoyed another collaboration with director Anderson in _Magnolia (1999)_ (qv) and continued with an outstanding performance in _The End of the Affair (1999)_ (qv), for which she garnered another Oscar nomination. She ended 1999 with another great performance, that of a grieving mother in _A Map of the World (1999)_ (qv), opposite 'Sigourney Weaver' (qv)."

         "biography":"By the time brawny baritone 'Harve Presnell' (qv) arrived on the film scene, the \"Golden Age\" of musicals had long passed. Born in Modesto, California in 1933, he graduated from Modesto High School and initially trained for an operatic career. He was performing nationally when the opportunity for Broadway first came his way. Legendary composer 'Meredith Willson' (qv) happened to catch an earful of the gifted singer in concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles and, in the virile mold of an 'Alfred Drake' (qv) or 'Howard Keel' (qv), wrote the role of Johnny \"Leadville\" Brown in \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" specifically for him as a showcase. The Broadway musical, with 'Tammy Grimes' (qv) as the spunky title heroine, was a resounding hit while Harve wrapped his glorious tonsils around such sturdy, wide-stanced songs as \"Colorado, My Home\" and \"I'll Never Say No.\" Unlike Grimes, Presnell managed to recreate his part when the celluloid version of _The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964)_ (qv) came out with a certifiable film star, the indomitable 'Debbie Reynolds' (qv), inhabiting the backwoods role. The film version was also hugely popular with audiences. It seemed like a star was about to be born but there were precious few movie musicals for Presnell to sink his teeth into and he quickly faded into the woodwork. He tried adjusting to straight dramatics with the rugged western _The Glory Guys (1965)_ (qv) and sang again in the highly unworthy teen frolic _When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965)_ (qv) with 'Connie Francis' (qv), but little else came his way. The disastrous film version of _Paint Your Wagon (1969)_ (qv) starring the highly miscast 'Lee Marvin' (qv), 'Clint Eastwood' (qv) and 'Jean Seberg' (qv), was redeemed only by the presence of Presnell and his superb rendition of \"They Call the Wind Mariah.\"By the 70s he was finished in films and was relegated to Keel-like stock and tour roles in such productions as \"Annie Get Your Gun\" (as Frank Butler) and \"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,\" among others. He even played Rhett Butler in a musical version of \"Gone With the Wind\" at London's Drury Lane Theatre, but did not generate much of a stir. In 1979, Presnell served as a replacement in the Broadway musical \"Annie\" as Daddy Warbucks and stayed with the role for years on tour, also reprising the tycoon in the failed 90s sequel \"Annie II: Miss Hannigan's Revenge,\" which was later retitled \"Annie Warbucks.\"More than 25 years had passed by the time Presnell returned to the movies as a brash and balding character actor. He struck pure gold as the righteous, dominating, ill-fated father-in-law of 'William H. Macy' (qv) in the Coen Brothers' cult film hit _Fargo (1996)_ (qv). This success, in turn, led to meaty roles in _Larger Than Life (1996)_ (qv), _The Whole Wide World (1996)_ (qv), _The Chamber (1996)_ (qv), _Face/Off (1997)_ (qv), _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv) and _The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)_ (qv), to name a few. Over the course of his career, he has proven himself a strong presence on TV as well with recurring roles on prime-time (\"Lois & Clark\") and daytime (\"Ryan's Hope\"). Presnell may have been born 10-20 years too late to have become a singing film star, but he has come back in spades to launch a whole new career as a noted character performer. Recent roles at age 70+ include TV's \"The Pretender,\" \"The Monk\" and \"ER,\" and the films _Mr. Deeds (2002)_ (qv) and _Old School (2003)_ (qv), indicate there are no signs that the twice-married actor is interested in slowing down."

He road the rails as a hobo for years during the Depression before arriving in Hollywood in 1936. Theatre work, including directing, eventually brought him to the attention of a talent scout, who contracted him to Columbia Studios. Famous for his character roles in slapstick comedy (he claims to have appeared in 450 movies), he became a regular in shorts and feature films with the Three Stooges, making thirty-five shorts with the boys before 1958. He holds the further distinction of appearing with each of the six Stooges (Moe, Shemp, and Curly Howard; 'Larry Fine' (qv); Joe Besser; and Joe DeRita). Sitka's most famous role, as a justice of the peace who begins every service with the words, \"Hold hands, you love birds\", brought him lasting fame among Stooge fans, who would sometimes ask him to repeat the phrase during their own wedding ceremonies."

         "biography":"Benevolent, sweet-faced, actress and comedienne 'Julia Sweeney' (qv), who was born in 1959 in Spokane, Washington, is normally identified with one single, highly unappetizing androgynous character. This sniveling, chunky-framed, springy-haired, plaid shirt-wearing, grotesque-looking character named Pat was the basis of many hilarious sketches that toyed with revealing his/her true gender. The oldest of five children, Julia demonstrated an early talent for mimicry but downplayed any interest in performing for serious college studies. She first came into contact with the show business arena following graduation. Behind the scenes she worked for five years as an accountant for Columbia Studios in Los Angeles. Developing the courage to realize her dream, she started taking classes on a whim at the famed Groundlings Theater. After fine-tuning her skills in improv, character development and sketch-writing, Julia was escalated to the big time when she was selected to join _\"Saturday Night Live\" (1975)_ (qv) in 1990 as a featured player. Though she became a regular cast member the following season and found an instant audience rapport with her creepy Pat character, she was vastly underused, which seemed to be the case for many of its distaff team at the time. \"Pat\" would outshine practically everything else she did on the show, including her timid wallflower type named \"Mea Culpa,\" whose character became the basis of a stage show co-written by Julia and actor/writer/husband 'Stephen Hibbert' (qv) called \"Mea's Big Apology\" in 1992. Discouraged, Julia parted ways with SNL in 1994 and worked up a feature film version of _It's Pat (1994)_ (qv) while her irons in the fire were hot. She co-wrote the script with Hibbert and co-starred with 'Dave Foley' (qv) who played Pat's equally androgynous partner \"Chris.\" The feature film did not generate great buzz, however, as it was basically a one-joke premise stretched to the limit. Following this and a few other insignificant character cameos on film, life turned extremely dark for Julia. Divorced from Hibbert, brother Michael developed lymphoma. She and her family vainly tried to nurse him back to health. Following his death, Julia herself was forced to fight a life-threatening illness -- cervical cancer. The whole process triggered an outpouring of writing which evolved into a hit one-woman stage show entitled, \"God Said, Ha!\" Applauded for its candor, wit and humorous handling of such painful subjects, the monologue debuted in San Francisco in 1995, and was playing Broadway by November of the following year. Preserving her work on film, she wrote and directed, with 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) in the producer's chair. While embracing this second career-defining moment, Julia won an Audience Award at the New York Comedy Festival in 1998 for her efforts, and earned a Grammy nomination for the CD version. She went on to complete a trilogy of personal sojourns. \"In the Family Way\" (2003) recounted her experience adopting a daughter as a single parent, and \"Letting Go of God\" (2004) traced her religious roots from devout Catholic to atheist."

The film garnered critical acclaim and the director became a legend in the England, UK and the cult film circuit. Two years later he followed up 'Dogs' with the film _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv). 'Pulp' premiered at the Cannes film festival, where it won the coveted 'Palme D'Or' the virtual equal of the Best Picture at the Academy Awards. At the 1995 Academy Awards, 'Pulp' was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, also for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, among others. Tarantino and writing partner 'Roger Avary' (qv) came away with the award only for Best Original Screenplay. In 1995, Tarantino directed one fourth of the Anthology _Four Rooms (1995)_ (qv) with friends and fellow auteurs 'Alexandre Rockwell' (qv), 'Robert Rodriguez' (qv), and 'Allison Anders' (qv). That film was released on December 25th in the United States to very weak reviews. This is mainly due to the heavy cutting of the first two segments and the introduction which make much of the plotline unintelligible, and creates a complete mess out of the second segment, directed by 'Alexandre Rockwell' (qv). The best two segments of the film are 'Robert Rodriguez' (qv)'s and Tarantino's. Tarantino's next film was _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv), a crime/vampire film which he wrote and co-starred with 'George Clooney' (qv). The film did fairly well theatrically."

Uma grew up in Amherst, Massachusetts, where her father worked at Amherst College. She left boarding school at just 15, already determined to become an actress. She moved to New York to follow her dream. A breakthrough role for the tall, blonde actress came when she played Cecile de Volanges in _Dangerous Liaisons (1988)_ (qv). More attention came with the NC-17 rated _Henry & June (1990)_ (qv), but it was Thurman's role in the 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) classic _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv) that earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Donning a short black wig to play femme fatale Mia Wallace opposite 'John Travolta' (qv)'s hit man Vincent Vega, Thurman earned a place in film history. After roles in _The Truth About Cats & Dogs (1996)_ (qv) and the 'Ted Demme' (qv) film _Beautiful Girls (1996)_ (qv), Thurman met her future husband 'Ethan Hawke' (qv) on the set of _Gattaca (1997)_ (qv). Thurman returned to smaller films after playing the villainess Poison Ivy in the reviled 'Joel Schumacher' (qv) effort _Batman & Robin (1997)_ (qv) and Emma Peel in a remake of _The Avengers (1998)_ (qv). She worked with 'Woody Allen' (qv) and 'Sean Penn' (qv) on _Sweet and Lowdown (1999)_ (qv), and starred in 'Richard Linklater' (qv)'s drama _Tape (2001)_ (qv) opposite Hawke. Thurman also won a Golden Globe award for her turn in the made-for-television film _Hysterical Blindness (2002) (TV)_ (qv), directed by 'Mira Nair' (qv). A return to the mainstream spotlight came when Thurman redeemed with 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) for _Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)_ (qv), a revenge flick the two had dreamed up on the set of _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv). She also turned up in the 'John Woo' (qv) cautioner _Paycheck (2003)_ (qv) that same year. The renewed attention was not altogether welcome because Thurman was dealing with the break-up of her marriage with Hawke at about this time. Thurman handled the situation with grace, however, and took her surging popularity in stride. She garnered critical acclaim for her work in _Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)_ (qv) and was hailed as Tarantino's muse. Thurman reunited with _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv) dance partner 'John Travolta' (qv) for the _Get Shorty (1995)_ (qv) sequel _Be Cool (2005)_ (qv) and landed a role in _The Producers (2005)_ (qv) after 'Nicole Kidman' (qv) backed out of the project."

Jerry works in his father-in-law's car dealership and has gotten himself in financial problems. He tries various schemes to come up with money needed for a reason that is never really explained. It has to be assumed that his huge embezzlement of money from the dealership is about to be discovered by father-in-law. When all else falls through, plans he set in motion earlier for two men to kidnap his wife for ransom to be paid by her wealthy father (who doesn't seem to have the time of day for son-in-law). From the moment of the kidnapping, things go wrong and what was supposed to be a non-violent affair turns bloody with more blood added by the minute. Jerry is upset at the blood shed, which turns loose a pregnant sheriff from MN who is tenacious in attempting to solve the three murders in her jurisdiction.",
