Setup:
The default configuration uses a SQLite database. So there is no need to set up
a database.

If you haven't already setup your PYTHONPATH - now is the time!
Define an evironment variable named PYTHONPATH pointing to the directory 
containig your Python apps.

Example: export PYTHONPATH='/home/foo/projects/python/':$PYTHONPATH

The following extensions are required:
- BeautifulSoup 3.1.0.1 (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
- feedparser 4.1 (http://feedparser.org/)
- imdb 3.9 (http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/)

The following Django apps are required:
- tagging 0.3 (http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging/)


Run this commands in the sandoval directory:
python manage.py syncdb # setup up the database structure
python manage.py loaddata feeds # loads a few feeds into the database
python manage.py loaddata testing # if you need some test data
python manage.py runserver # start the server

To import from the feeds configured in the database run this command:
python movie/insertion/feeds.py

To import a single movie by name run this command:
python movie/insertion/movie.py 'Fargo'

This command truncates the movie app tables:
python manage.py clear movie
