Sandoval is a movie application build with the Django Framework. It's main
purpose is to show the capabilities of Django.

Setup:
The default configuration uses a SQLite database. So there is no need to set up
a database.

Run this commands in the sandoval directory:

python manage.py syncdb # setup up the database structure
python manage.py loaddata feeds # loads a few feeds into the database
python manage.py loaddata testing # if you need some test data
python manage.py runserver # start the server

To import from the feeds configured in the database run this command:

python movie/feedreader.py

This command truncates the movie app tables:

python manage.py clear movie
